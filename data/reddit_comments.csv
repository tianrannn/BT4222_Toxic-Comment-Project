1,"I was in Waikiki where two confirmed cases were about two weeks ago. I ended up in the hospital here in Los Angeles three days after getting back. I had pneumonia in my left lung. I asked to be screened for Coronavirus and was denied. I went back today because I’m still coughing blood. I was denied coronavirus testing again. Just pneumonia meds not that there is a med for Coronavirus. 

I don’t know why the news is reporting what it is reporting. A major hospital in Los Angeles with me as a patient that has exact Coronavirus symptoms is denied testing. Five day fever, cough, shortness of breath, blood in mucus, confirmed pneumonia, and so on. The CDC told the hospital that I can’t be tested since I haven’t travelled to Iran, Italy, or China. If you do not fit the CDC mold here in California then you can’t be tested.",t3_fe9i00,False,MaplewoodDUDE,1583478426.0,314
2,"I'm a student at Lake Washington School Distrct in the Seattle area where  we are suffering the most cases in the country. 10 people have died. All  the private schools have closed but our district has stubbornly decided  to stay open to maintain ""stability"", putting MANY people at risk. They say they won't cancel school until someone gets sick, until it's too  late.

Some kids in the area made [this petition](http://chng.it/hgsT6n9p) and it got over 16,000 signatures. The local news [reported on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKmx2ujHp-0)  about an hour ago and all of us are hoping the district will see it by  morning. Please like the video, sign the petition, and make some  comments too to help the algorithm. All of us are losing our shit right now and we really hope the district makes the right decision.

Healthcare and EMS particularly is significantly overwhelmed and understaffed. That's nothing new and was happening even before the Coronavirus outbreak. 

With 14 day isolation precautions in regards to coronavirus, we could see serious and significant staffing problems for ambulances, hospitals, firefighters, and police. 

On the topic of EMS are limiting the use of N95 masks. Limiting them to confirmed cases or highly suspected cases, and that definition is gray. We go to multiple hospitals, nursing homes, our fire station, and public areas on a daily basis. We could come in contact with a patient exhibiting signs and symptoms, but do not meet our requirement to wear N95s. It could spread like wildfire before we ever get confirmation that they do in fact have coronavirus. Than, that ambulance crew and any fire personnel, healthcare workers, and anyone else will need to isolate for 14 days. Eventually this could mean a significantly limited 911 response, to the point of ambulances no longer being available to respond to any medical emergencies.",t3_fe9i00,False,Blueiguana1100,1583477029.0,110
6,"The people who are not taking this situation seriously make me despair. It is not just Coronavirus that will be killing people during this outbreak. Emergency surgeries from accidents, heart attacks, strokes, and other medical emergencies will be impacted because these cases often need a couple of days in ICU after surgery but the ICU is now full of virus patients. Elective surgeries that people have been waiting for months for are being canceled for the same reason. Organ transplants will be off the agenda so people will die waiting. Those who have been waiting for hip replacements etc will have to remain in pain and unable to move around for the foreseeable future. 

My brother-in-law is scheduled for surgery on the 28th of this month. He already has a 50% chance of losing his leg and without the surgery he has a huge chance of dying. I was due for an operation on the 27th. Without surgery my life will be limited and painful. BIL and I are in isolation at home so we don't get sick before our surgical dates.

If you have friends and family that are blasé about the risk this virus poses, ask them if they are ok with infecting others who will then be filling hospitals so that emergency patients cannot get the treatment they need to live.

TL;DR: disinfecting works and won't compromise the mask

1. Oven at 70C 30 min/ UV light at 254nm 303uw/cm\^2 30sec will effectively disinfect the mask without compromise it at all
2. liquid disinfectant can effectively disinfect the mask, but will reduce the filtering efficacy much more significant than dry methods
3. BUT, among several liquid disinfectant tested, they only reduce filtering efficacy by around 1% AT MOST!! N95 masks can be effectively disinfected with alcohol and still at 94% efficacy, no longer higher than 95% but it's still very effective protection!

77,"Doubt anyone will read this, but here goes:

I've been following along to this subreddit, trying to get facts and not succumb to hysteria. With the news wanting big stories, that's hard to do.

So just today at work, I was in a LARGE hospital (largest hospital in several states, with a cancer center, full heart institute, full pediatric center, you get the idea) for a meeting.

We walked through many parts of the hospital, from the main entrance, staff/admin areas, through patient areas and even through the basement and mechanical/electrical service areas.

One guy made a joke about ""corona and lime"" like no one has heard that joke before. \*eye roll\*

&#x200B;

\*\*We were all in a big circle, talking, and this other guy, who is a fairly high level project manager, pulls out a tissue and blows his nose right in front of us. He digs it into his nostrils and pushes it around (to get all the mucous???) It was LOUD and disgusting. He puts the tissue back into his pocket, then with his RIGHT hand, rubs his nose a few times and sniffs loudly.\*\*

&#x200B;

He shook a few hands after that, and was walking around, opening doors, touching elevator buttons, using his phone.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, since I've interfaced with the healthcare industry a long time (but not a doctor or nurse) I'm in the habit of 'foam in/foam out' like entering and leaving a patient room. Basically, at the hospital, every time I pass a Purell foam station, you bet I get two squirts of foam and rub my hands together.

&#x200B;

One person in our group looked at me and tried making a joke about me being paranoid about getting sick. I just said ""meh, I spend time in hospitals, so it's a habit."" Meanwhile, I'm thinking: ""Some dude in our group just blew his nose and rubbed his snot on his hand, and has been touching surfaces, AND you shook his hand! And there are sick people all around us, some with masks, in this enormous hospital that takes up many city blocks. And you think I'm silly for using hand sanitizer?""

&#x200B;

If people could just wash their hands, cover when they cough and sneeze, and use sanitizer like they should, not only would coronavirus die out, but there wouldn't be such a big problem with the flu, colds and other such illness.

94,"In our house we've drafted a plan for NYC coronavirus in the event that one of us in our 3 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment (3 people) gets infected. Here are the mitigation efforts we are performing and a plan we've strategized in the event that one of us gets sick and infected with coronavirus (*and cannot seek medical help for some reason*).

Feel free to leave any feedback or improvements to the plan, also feel free to adapt/use this as a potential framework.

# Mitigation Efforts

* When arriving home, all roommates **MUST** use hand sanitizer at the door **BEFORE** touching any other surfaces  

   * One may also use the sink located in the laundry room, *assuming the infected roommate plan is not in place*
* Shoes must be taken off at the door and carried to your bedroom
* All roommates should participate in sanitizing high touch surfaces with lysol wipes including light switches, door knobs, handles, faucets, toilet, shower, and other areas
* All dishes must be placed in the dishwasher  

   * Dishes may be placed in the sink if the dishwasher is running
* All large gatherings must seek roommate approval to host
* **If you display any symptoms (fever, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat) all roommates must be notified immediately regardless of severity**  

   * **Depending on severity of symptoms, the other roommates will have the final call on enacting the infected roommate plan or requesting the potentially infected roommate to seek medical help**
   * **See infected roommate plan for mitigation efforts**

# Infected Roommate Plan ☣︎

In the event one of us becomes infected or shows strong symptoms of the virus, here are the proposed mitigation efforts.

* If light symptoms (cough/fever/sore throat), they should isolate in their bedroom and follow the below mitigation measures.
* If strong symptoms (persistent fever/cough/sore throat/trouble breathing) the person should seek medical care at a hospital. The following mitigation measures apply.
* Self quarantine in their bedroom until the fever and cough has subsided for 48 hours without use of flu medication/cough suppressant/fever reducers
* When leaving their bedroom a non ventilated N-95 or surgical mask must be worn at all times by the infected person.  

   * Close all windows in the quarantine room before leaving, to ensure the draft does not carry the virus through the house (in the event of the front door opening)
* **Before** entering the bathroom or kitchen, they must use the sink located in the laundry room to wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.
* A trash bag must be kept in their own bedroom. All tissues, food scraps, trash, etc. must be disposed of in their own garbage bag, NOT in the communal garbage locations, including the bathroom.  

   * When the garbage bag is full, they must notify the other roommates to dispose of it properly.  

      * The garbage bag must be taken directly from their bedroom/door **DIRECTLY** to the curb (*regardless of day of week*). Gloves are required for touching trash and the person must clean their hands after.
* After using the bathroom they must sanitize (lysol wipe) any touched surface including sink faucets, light switches, shower doors, or other surfaces.  

   * If they are unable to perform this task, they must notify the other roommates that they have used the restroom and did not sanitize surfaces
* Towels for the restroom must be kept in their own bedroom and placed in a specific location within the bathroom (designated towel rack) to be sanitized after.
* If using the shower, after use they must notify other roommates that they have used the shower so it can be properly sanitized
* If using the laundry machine, after use they must sanitize the laundry machine with an empty load and ½ cup of bleach or notify roommates to perform this task
* All dishes MUST be placed in the dishwasher  

   * If the dishwasher is running, they must leave dishes in their room until they can be safely placed in the dishwasher.
* Roommate(s) will be tasked with leaving food/water/supplies in front of their door, grocery shopping, and ensuring their comfort during their quarantine/illness
* All high touch surfaces must be cleaned consistently by the other roommates
* Constant communication with the infected person to ensure their health & wellbeing via digital chat or checking by knocking on their door
* Contact information of the infected persons parents/contacts should be shared
* Insurance information should be made available so roommates will have knowledge in the event medical assistance is required",t3_fe9i00,False,AWildMichigander,1583541909.0,12

Closed cases = deaths + recoveries. Keep in mind, recoveries have not been well reported in most countries.

DISCLAMER: lack of testing typically makes these death rates higher, because you aren't catching the mild cases. US also got hit in the worst possible place: nursing home. Their rate \*should\* fall as more people are tested

This number would give a sense of how widespread the disease is, and how forceful a response to it the United States is mustering. But for days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has refused to publish such a count, despite public anxiety and criticism from Congress. On Monday, Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, estimated that “by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed” in the United States. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence promised that “roughly 1.5 million tests” would be available this week. 

But the number of tests performed across the country has fallen far short of those projections, despite extraordinarily high demand, The Atlantic has found.

158,"**Updates to my CFR model:**  
Instead of just picking the shape of the outcome probability curve, I realized that what I am  really trying to model is a Cumulative Density Function which is the integral of a normal distribution representing the behavior of a random (gaussian) event.  I also add the normal distribution fit for time it takes from diagnosed to recovered.

**Hypothesis:**  
The 2.3% and later 3.4% numbers seem to be the ratio of deaths/confirmed cases. However deaths tend to occur after diagnosis, so the true death counts will lag confirmed cases by days to weeks. This would imply that the ratio of current deaths to current confirmed cases, under-represents the actual CFR, once you allow for the recently diagnosed to resolve. 

**Plots:** [https://imgur.com/a/gVh0uml](https://imgur.com/a/gVh0uml)

**Steps:**

* Represent the death and recovered event probability vs days-after-diagnosis as a normal distribution
* Integrate the normal distributions to get a Cumulative Density Function, which now represents the probability of being dead or recovered as a function of days-after-diagnosis
* Apply the CDF separately to each population of confirmed cases per-day
* Sum the outcomes of each daily population to get the total death/recovered outcomes per-day
* Use least squares to estimate the sigma and mean of the normal distribution, such that the daily predicted totals match the actual totals

**Data:**

* John's Hopkins dataset: [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases - Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)

**Code:**

* [https://gist.github.com/ctung/b31726c64e55b7ce48887f98b52c6acf](https://gist.github.com/ctung/b31726c64e55b7ce48887f98b52c6acf)

**Caveats:**

* This model does not factor in age, location, pre-existing co-morbidities, etc, so it will not be useful for predicting individual outcomes
* Changes in the length of time to complete a diagnosis will skew the end results.
* This models deaths vs confirmed cases (CFR). This does not attempt to model deaths vs infections (IFR).
* Outcomes may not be normal (eg the CFR in Wuhan is most likely very different than the CFR in other provinces or countries)  Here I am lumping all cases together as a global count because data outside of China is too sparse to model at this time.

**Conclusions from the model** (which may or may not be true)

* The CFR has to be around 4% to accurately explain the death count profile.
* The mean date for death is 7 days after diagnosis ( I have read the actual is 14?)
* Some small percentage of the confirmed cases are determined post-mortem?
* recovery takes on average 21 days after diagnosis

**Next Steps:**

* Incorporate age into the model
* Experiment with estimates of untested infection counts to estimate IFR (Like the recently publish Harvard paper)
* Try to find datasets that can validate some of the conclusions from the model

180,"u/gafonid sry guy, that posts are locked so I can't answer you at that posts. here's the information about ""Patient age distribution"" from a Chinese web media(it's established by a group of professional doctors, not gov. many Chineses trust them).

I'm not sure how to upload a picture... I have a picture of this, a data for February 18th, but it is intuitive so I use it

[https://upload.cc/i1/2020/03/07/cV2TQX.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2020/03/07/cV2TQX.png)

age 0 30 40 50 60 70

the upper graph: confirmed cases:10.3% 17% 19.2% 22.4% 19.2% 11.9%

the lower graph:death cases:0.8% 1.8% 3.7% 12.7% 30.2% 50.8%

and the text under the graph: Only half of the patients over 50 years old in confirmed cases, but in the death case, 93.7% of patients over 50 years old. it means all age could be infected, But older people are more likely to die.

so older people are more dangerous, it's true, but we also heard some young people die. a doctor called Li Wenliang (you can search the name) 35 years old, who warned about this plague, He was diagnosed on February 1, he posted the message about his condition on Weibo (a web like twitter), then his situation became very terrible on February 6. The doctor spared no effort to rescue him, even used ECMO. but unfortunately, it's too late. he died so fast.

I hope the doctors of other countries can treat the elderly effectively. if you are young people, don't too worry, stay optimistic, but be alert. the patient may be worsened,  they need a ventilator to support their breath. So you can't think ""I can walk or run, that's ok, no problem"". Don't take it lightly, if the bad thing happens, you feel hard to breathe, please wear PPE to avoid cross-infection, and go to the hospital, don't take oxygen at home by yourself.  We paid so many lives to learn this lesson.

#Many retail pharmacies are already understaffed. With COVID-19, it is eventually going to be even harder to find employees to keep pharmacies open and serving the public.

Chain owners and their district managers need to:

1) Temporarily employ a larger number of floating pharmacists and techs so that pharmacies will have the available man-power to stay open.

1.5) On this same note and as we all know, many pharmacists feel pressure to work while being sick because it's too hard to find a replacement on short notice.

This needs to be changed immediately.

Pharmacists need to be able to call in sick that morning to say they won't be coming in if they are suddenly feeling ill in order to prevent spreading the virus and to protect their own health.

For the past decade or longer, this has not been the case.

2) Install physical germ-barrier shields in pharmacies so that patients can't cough and sneeze on staff.

3) Provide masks and other protective medical gear for staff.

3.5) On that same note, if they could provide masks and hand sanitizer to patients who appear to be sick while waiting in line, that would be ideal.

4) Chains need to make sure that pharmacy staff have plenty of paid sick leave so that employees can afford to stay home and not work sick and/or in case they become quarantined to their homes for 2 weeks.

275,"At the end of this post is a paper from 2008 re coronaviruses in water.  I was a sailor in the RN and a thing we were ALWAYS hounded on was washing hands and body in HOT water. It is not enough to say wash your hands. I often claim never to drink water because ""fish piss in it"" and while that is a bit facetious, it gives me the right to drink hot drinks or booze. Note that at 4c coronaviruses still thrive in water. At 23c they 'inactivate' I presume hotter too. People on cruise ships, airplanes etc often drink water they are served, or take from a tap. Others believe that just washing hands will kill viruses of this kind. I have not seen a single post on this page that comments about water. (Nor the link to cruise ships etc.)  OK I won't rabbit on. The paper is hard enough to read, BUT I think most important if one is not to keep on passing this little thing around. BTW A report by Dr Norman Swan on the AUS ABC Health Report states that at Wuhan there were 44 samples taken and the ONLY sample that showed the virus was in a fish tank. NOT anywhere else.

294,"I'm trying my damn hardest to get my boyfriend a coronavirus test. We returned to Maryland after a funeral in Seattle last weekend and he now has a fever and a cough as of Wednesday. Yesterday, I got redirected to the state department of health and they were not testing anyone other than people who had traveled to Iran or China or people who had come in direct contact with a known case. 

But I read yesterday that the CDC had relaxed their guidelines to let people with doctor's orders to get tested. Cut to me finding out that we can't get a doctors order because he didn't see a PCP since his insurance switched in January and urgent care told me that only a PCP can write the order (?). Of course, no PCP wants him to come into the office for a new patient visit due to his symptoms. I called the same number for the state department of health today and, probably because we now have 3 confirmed cases in Maryland, she cut me off and told me to call 211 (which was useless).

I'm practically banging my head against my desk now. We might be able to go to the emergency room to get testing approved but his symptoms aren't that bad and we don't want to put the elderly or people with underlying issues at risk.

We've been selfisolating since Wednesday. Fortunately, his work is being cooperative but he has a public facing role in government and as of right now the recommendation is that he's okay to come back to work 24 hours after his symptoms reside instead of 14 days of selfisolation. They also want an okay to return to work note from a PCP which will require him to go to a PCP office while possibly still contagious (!!). As for me, I'm starting a new job on Monday and don't want to bring the virus with me if that's what he has.

Great news! Do you think this is because of the great healthcare system and/or treatment? 

OR will it just all come down delayed on Germany? OR could there be a flaw in the reporting system? (eg ""died of pneumonia"" instead of ""died of complications from COVID-19"")

Other EU countries close by like France and Italy are roughly within the WHO mortality statistic.

If this is indeed the big one that the WHO are talking about, how big is it going to be? Spanish Flu x 100? Global genocide? I can see a fuckload of more deaths in the forthcoming months as the spread continues, a lot of people are gonna die and get other people killed and that's what worries me

430,"**Open letter to the Belgian Prime Minister and to my fellow citizens - part 1**

Dear Prime Minister, dear fellow citizens,

Belgium has experienced many political crises, it is a local specialty for which we are famous in the world, but it ***is facing today its first real crisis since the Second World War***, and it turns out to be very badly prepared to respond to it effectively.

The attitude of the Ministry of Public Health is paternalistic, with the message: we are prepared, we have a pandemic plan, we have groups of experts, we are monitoring the situation closely, we are controlling the situation, we are communicating as it is necessary, and we are not interested in independent criticism of health professionals or scientists.

However, apart from the disinterest in the opinion of professionals independent of the government, nothing could be further from the truth: we are not prepared, we do not have a pandemic plan, government experts demonstrate a lack of knowledge of this new coronavirus characteristics, they follow the situation closely but refuse to anticipate it, and communication remains incoherent, for the simple reason that they do not sufficiently understand the nature of the danger we face.

**Belgium does not have a pandemic plan.**

This information will probably even surprise the Minister of Health, but Belgium does not in fact have a pandemic plan! Instead of having one, Belgium has an epidemic plan and there is a crucial difference between the two.

Contrary to epidemics where the foci of infections remain localized in certain regions of the globe, as was the case for both SARS and MERS, in a pandemic these foci continue to spread uncontrollably in most countries.

The consequence of this difference is a logistical problem; the supply chains of materials necessary for health care are interrupted. For this reason, ***a true pandemic plan is based on the concept of strategic reserve:***all the material necessary not only to ensure the normal functioning of our health care system, but also to have the capacity to absorb the inevitable increase in the number of patients to be treated must be kept in stock in sufficient quantity if it is not produced on Belgian territory.

We are already in shortage of masks, so Belgium does not have a pandemic plan. Contrary to the assertions of the Minister of Health, we are therefore not prepared and it is urgent that the government takes all the measures necessary to remedy this deficiency.

**Confronting the reality of the situation.**

Those who do not have the professional skills to judge the situation for themselves are reduced to trying to determine which expert is closest to the reality of the situation, an exercise in futility.

I believe, on the contrary, that it is possible to explain the reality of the situation in an intelligible way to the government and to the general public, but that requires everyone to make a little effort to understand the two most important figures in epidemiology from a public health perspective. Once this information is understood, ***everyone will be in a position to assess the proportionality of the public health measures***that have been taken and that remain to be taken.

**What are the conditions that favor the emergence of a pandemic?**

A new contagious virus for which the population has no immunity. The more contagious the virus, the greater the difficulty in containing it, the greater the risk of a pandemic. The flow of people and goods in the modern world, as well as the concentration of the population in urban areas increase the pandemic potential of emerging viruses.

**Public health measures to counter the spread of the virus.**

The spread of a virus is closely linked to the frequency of contact between individuals, the more contact there is, the more the probability of transmission increases. And so the essence of public health measures for a pandemic virus is to ***reduce the frequency of contact between individuals as much as possible,***it is no secret.

**Can we contain the spread of a virus with pandemic potential?**

Yes, if the required public health measures are implemented without delay. Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, countries that have much closer contacts with China, have been able to stem the spread of the virus in their country. They were exposed to the SARS epidemic in 2003 and their public health officials learned the right lessons. They were ready, and that ***proves that it is possible to have an effective response to a pandemic***.

**Containing a pandemic virus is a race against time.**

On the starting line, we have a new virus and public health systems around the world. The virus starts first, but slowly, and it is up to health systems to respond without delay, as the virus spreads faster by the day. The virus respects neither borders nor schedules, and it does not take a break during the carnival holidays. The Minister of Health assures us that we are 5-6 weeks behind Italy. We are 22 days behind Italy. ***Every day counts.***

**Usual dangers and unusual dangers.**

People are generally well prepared for the dangers they face regularly, because these dangers correspond to their usual experience. ***No one is psychologically prepared for a pandemic,***the last one took place a little over 100 years ago and therefore no one has personal experience of a pandemic: it is very difficult for people to anticipate the explosive nature of the spread of an infectious agent, even though it is well established scientifically that a virus spreads exponentially.

**Exponential multiplication**

Apart from financiers, engineers and scientists, the properties of the exponential function remain very abstract for members of government and the general public, and I will try to make them more concrete. We are all very familiar with the functions of addition and multiplication because we use them daily. The exponential function is a series of multiplication, and our intuition is less developed on the implications of a series multiplication, because there are few phenomena around us that flagrantly follow this function.

To make it clear what is going on in a pandemic, I would like to make the connection with two exponential phenomena with which most people are familiar.

**The compound interest loan and the stick of dynamite**

A stick of dynamite and compound interest are two exponential phenomena with which we are familiar. What happens when dynamite explodes?

One molecule of TNT reacts and makes 1000 other molecules react a fraction of a second later, and that is 1000 molecules in turn make each 1000 other molecules react the same fraction of a second later, and this million molecules which react, produce a billion, then a trillion etc., every fraction of a second until all the TNT has reacted in less than a second. Result? BOOM, the stick exploded.

At the other end of the speed spectrum, you can take compound interest. Consider buying a loan-funded home with an annual interest rate of 2.5%. You may think, 2.5% is not much, but if you do the math, on a 30-year contract you end up paying as much in interest as the price of the house. And that's the power of the exponential function, it goes up quickly, with an annual rate of 5%, we pay more than 3 times the price of the house in interest! The predatory and amoral character of our financial system is a debate for another day, but is an important factor in the systemic precariousness of modern society, which can only be exposed by the developing crisis.

A pandemic is halfway between a compound interest loan and a stick of dynamite. ***The three phenomena are explosive,***but at different time scales, of the order of the week, year and millisecond.

484,"Hello,

I work in a hospital (Ont, Canada) in protection services (security) and there’s been an issue puzzling me for some time. I’ve been following the outbreak since the end of January and Canada now has 48 cases. 

My team is 13-14 guys and we require a minimum of 2-3 per shift, 24/7.

I was also here during the Swine Flu epidemic in 2009, right after I finished college. And I was a part-time swine flu screener then. This seems to be worse in terms of severity.

Yesterday I’ve begun compiling a resources based on China’s handling — and I’ve noted that most of their healthcare workers are always in hazmat suits and their infection rates are reportedly decreasing on the great spectrum of this thing.

The reason I bring that forth is not only for my own safety, but also because if I have to endure a 14 day self-quarantine — or worse — I get sick and am out for weeks longer, I’m unsure we’d have the sustained resources to keep our team up to par. And I can imagine we will only get busier when more people start getting sick.

If I get sick or exposed, my partner(s) will also need to be quarantined. It would be dangerous to have our entire team get sick because we’re not in proper PPE when dealing with patients and patrons and our team would ultimately all possibly end up out.

I want to convince my boss (who is in charge of pandemic planning) to permit guards to wear full hazmat suits and N95s so as to prevent getting sick as well as asymptomatically spreading it. So we suit up before shifts; get disinfected throughout and then at the end before removing the PPE. Does this seem like a reasonable measure?

It appears to me that both China and South Korea are both doing this. 

The same goes for other staff; nurses, EVS (cleaners), food services, logistical staff, etc. Unlike China, I don’t see my country taking these risks serious enough.

Again,‘it’s not the ailment that concerns me more than it’s running out of manpower if we have to quarantine and it seems wearing 24/7 PPE while here would help mitigate that.",t3_fe9i00,False,APXlife,1583483331.0,3

&#x200B;

 Ms \[point of contact\],

If you will recall, I emailed you a week ago, because I was concerned there would not be sufficient planning in place for once coronavirus was upon us in Tulsa.  As you are now I'm sure aware, it is here.  It has in fact been here since 2/23, four days before my last email.

I find TPS's most recent email entirely inadequate as a response.  I am aware that there has been no federal or state decree for your organization to take action, but I plea to you, as a fellow human being, to consider you humanity and act for the good of our entire community.

Perhaps you are unaware of the risk coronavirus brings.  It is 20 times more lethal than the seasonal flu for people in my demographic, and 60 times more deadly for those in my parents' age bracket.  Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine available.  Left unchecked, it has a doubling time of roughly three days on average.  Being as it's been in Tulsa for 12 days, the math for projected number of infected works out like this:  1(initial infected) \* 1.26 \^ 12days = 16.  That's 15 Tulsans that are currently carrying coronavirus if the spread has followed the global trend.  As a state, we have conducted a total of **6 tests**.  We are considerably far behind the curve on this, and will likely not catch up.  By next Friday, the trend projects there will be 80 Tulsans with the virus.  What are the odds any of those people have contact with school age children?

This virus is the most dangerous since the spanish flu and has the potential to kill tens of millions worldwide over the next year.  The impact will be determined largely by how swiftly local communities react to halt the spread.  Children have been shown to have mild reactions to the virus and recover quickly, so their individual risk is low, however, they are also perfect vectors for the disease, typically showing little in the way of symptoms even while infectious.  Elderly and those with pre-existing conditions are not so lucky.  They will be in intense competition for medical care, and overwhelming the medical system will drastically increase the fatality rate.  The most important thing we as a community can do, is to reduce the pace of propagation.

I'm aware you're under intense pressure to maintain attendance, but please listen when I implore you to consider your humanity.  This is a once in a lifetime disease with the potential for mass devastation if not handled with the utmost respect.  You will not receive guidance from the state or CDC on this - not until it is far too late. It is therefore up to you, as an organization, to use common sense to protect your community.  TPS has the opportunity to make the single most impact in slowing this disease in Tulsa.  Doing so now can save thousands of lives.  Now is the time to act.  Now is the time to pull out all the stops if we are to have any say in the result of this pandemic on our community.  Please reconsider your most recent guidance. To do nothing is to condemn the city to endemic disease.  Please start planning immediately for remote learning and closure of schools as this is likely our only hope to avert crisis.  We need a plan for those in place now, and we need to act on it the very moment we see community spread in our City.  We have a tremendously valuable opportunity before us today - please act before it abandons us.

I say all of this as someone who has the utmost respect for education, for all that you do, and for our children and seniors.

Thank you,

You can make an app where everyone will be able to check whether he was or wasn't in that place and need to go to quarantine.

I'm currently living just outside a major EU city with a recent small but steady uptick in cases. I got a call last night that my grandfather (in the US) passed away (not virus-related at all - long-standing heart issues). It seems unavoidable that I'll have to travel internationally very soon for the funeral.

Aside from my own grief and being there for my family, I can't help but worry about COVID-19. Not only do I not want to catch it, but I don't want to potentially spread it to others, either.

Some practical questions that I'd love to throw out for discussion:

* What's the safest way to travel? I've been toying with two options, but I can't decide which is safer:
   * Fly from MyCity to the closest city to my parents in the US (nonstop flights available, but they're quite long)
   * Book a private sleeper cabin with a private bathroom on an overnight train from MyCity to a different major EU city that has shorter nonstop flights to the destination city. Avoid leaving the cabin the entire time; bring my own food onboard. Would involve transiting from the train station to the airport.
* How to stay as safe/healthy as possible for the funeral services? I expect friends and relatives will be coming in from other US cities, and I assume there's going to be a lot of hugging and kissing, hand-shaking, etc. There will be a lot of older folks present, and I wouldn't want to pass anything to them. :(
* On that note, here comes the eternal debate: mask or no mask for me?

685,"To be honest the whole United States should be aware of this virus. Although it’s curable, you may not discover yourself get infected with this disease since it’s incubation period can have 2-14 days, along with normal symptoms like cough and fever. 

If I were you, I would only take China’s infection number as reference as the actual cases must be more than that. Frankly, by doing some online research, you may discovered that the first outbreak of the coronavirus is more likely between October and November 2019. In between this two months, there are some weird increase of keyword searching such as shortness of breath, coronavirus and SARS in China’s social media. There are also reports about a couple of people who spread the news of coronavirus were being arrested in October due to spreading out false comment on the internet in china, news weren’t posted that long since the Chinese government deleted it. The another interesting part to think about is the Hong Kong postal service has stopped their delivery service in November, and specifically stated Wuhan. After all, you may wonder when does the outbreak happen actually, and how long does the government know about it.

Coronavirus is already an unavoidable disease in United States, but what matters is how will we deal with it. Just remember your hands will always get dirty after you touch something outside your home, so never touch your face with your hands before you clean your hands by washing it, using alcoholic wipes or hand sanitizer. 

Furthermore, it is also crucial to wear a face mask. However, be aware to buy the effective one, since not all mask are able to avoid the virus. In America, purchasing mask with the standards ASTM is definitely trustworthy, or BFE/VFE/PFE>97%. Dust mask is never effective!!! If you can’t purchase mask (as I have known face mask has already been in shortage since January), you can design by your own, as long as it can prevent others droplets from touching your face.

It is also essential for knowing how to wear a mask. Remember the coloured side always face away from your face and the white side always touches your face. Whenever you put on or take off your mask, try to touch the ear loop only, and never touch the coloured side since it’s full of bacteria.

Our school district is at the [EPICENTER](https://qz.com/1810763/the-first-covid-19-death-in-the-us-has-been-reported-near-seattle/) of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States - Kirkland, Washington. 3 of our high schools serve the Kirkland area - Juanita, Tesla STEM, and Lake Washington. What has the district done in response to the immediate danger and threat to student and family safety? [Nothing](https://www.lwsd.org/programs-and-services/health-services/coronavirus-information)! Their decision today (March 5, 2020), and previously has been to keep all school activities OPEN. This includes before/after school clubs, rehearsals, athletic activities, and the 6 hours of instruction in between. They are basing this on advice from the CDC and WSDOH, which don't have the resources or boots on the ground to predict the virus's spread prior to symptoms and diagnosis.

This shows a worrying level of incompetence and lack of preparation. Thousands of students trust LWSD with their safety on a daily basis. If there is a failure in leadership now, the virus will affect district students, potentially allowing it to be carried to more vulnerable family members and leading to tragic, preventable cases. As if to tip the hat at the situation, however, the district IS allowing families to call in excused absences if they feel an ""abundance of caution"".

This is not enough. One of my peers said it best, ""you evacuate the school before a disaster, not afterwards."" The virus has an incubation period of 5 - 14 days, leading to invisible spread and consequences rendered long before any symptoms appear. Please spread awareness and [sign the petition](http://chng.it/hgsT6n9p) to convince the school district to put student safety over financial and administrative incentives.

China didn't shut down a city the size of NY just because they were afraid of accidentally killing 2 percent of the world's population.  They did it because they knew the virus would be bad enough to not only kill 2 percent but put 16-20 percent in the hospital and make 80 percent of the world mildly sick roughly around the same time.  

Those numbers don't seem bad and the illness itself compared to others isn't crazy bad for most people, which is why they're not freaking out.  But if they consider these numbers and the rate at which it will affect us they will see how much havoc this will be on healthcare systems, economic activity, and by extension political and social systems.

When people can't go to the hospital because they have a blood clot or a broken leg, when people can't get certain meds, when prices for goods increases, wages stagnant, and companies let people go, that's when the reality will sink in for them.

Getting the coronavirus isn't scary for most people.  But the consequences of almost everyone getting it at the same time, compounded by the 20 percent who will be in the hospitals if they're lucky.

> If we’re wrong by a factor of two regarding the fraction of severe cases, that only changes the timeline of bed saturation by 6 days in either direction. If 20% of cases require hospitalization, we run out of beds by ~May 2nd. 

> If only 5% of cases require it, we can make it until ~May 14th. 2.5% gets us to May 20th. This, of course, assumes that there is no uptick in demand for beds from *other* (non-COVID19) causes, which seems like a dubious assumption.

> As COVID19 cases saturate virtually every state and county, which seems likely to happen any day now, it will soon be irresponsible for all HCWs to not wear a mask. These HCWs would burn through N95 stockpile in 2 days if each HCW only got ONE mask per day. 

> Importantly, I cannot stress this enough: even if I’m wrong – even VERY wrong – about core assumptions like % of severe cases or current case #, it only changes the timeline by days or weeks. This is how exponential growth in an immunologically naïve population works.

> One more thought: you’ve probably seen multiple respected epidemiologists have estimated that 20-70% of world will be infected within the next year. If you use 6-day doubling rate I mentioned above, we land at ~2-6 billion infected by sometime in July of this year.

From CNN's Andy Rose and Jon Passantino 

Hawaii has confirmed its first novel coronavirus case, according to state officials at a Friday news conference.

Governor David Ige said the patient is a Hawaii resident who traveled on the Grand Princess cruise ship, which is now in quarantine off the coast of California. 

It’s the seventh confirmed case tied to the cruise ship.

Ige said the Hawaiian patient disembarked in Mexico, but officials are aware that the cruise ship also stopped at four Hawaiian ports last month. 

The state is examining the manifest of Grand Princess passengers to contact those who stopped in Hawaii, asking that they self-quarantine, he said.

Also, current growth rates are so fast only because no country has taken effectively proactive measures to stop it.

FYI masks are not still being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier.

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

What you describe is kind of the principle behind vaccination! Instead of low doses sometimes we kill the virus or just use the antibodies to teach our body's immune system.
If it happens slowly then yes it may be easier for your body to develop antibodies and systematically kill virus-controlled cells. Unfortunately we don't know too much right now about how our body reacts to Sars-CoV-2 yet in terms of making antibodies. Also a problem with these types of viruses: they accumulate mutations quickly to fight the body's natural defenses- meaning you could need vaccinations every few months or so when it has changed a lot.

Most of the infected patients were women (45 \[77·6%\] of 58) during Jan. 23 to 29, but less female (14 \[45·2%\] of 31) before Jan. 23. Patients admitted with more systemic symptoms such as fever (21 \[67·7%\] of 31), fatigue (13 \[41·9%\] of 31), and myalgia (7 \[22·6%\] of 31) before Jan. 23. Greater proportion of patients (10 \[32·3%\] of 31) admitted before Jan. 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a small proportion (4 \[6·9%\] of 58) admitted after Jan. 23. Other symptoms such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness were not significantly different between two groups. In addition, the group admitted before Jan. 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 \[54·2%\] of 24), CD3 (11\[52·4%\] of 21), CD8 (9 \[42·9%\] of 21) cells and elevated SAA (18 \[75·0%\] of 24).

**COPD and other pulmonary diseases**\- These people already have poorly functioning lungs. A respiratory virus increases their risk of experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring artificial breathing support (a ventilator). These people's lungs are not well-equipped to handle the inflammation from a respiratory virus. 

**Diabetes, hypertension**\- these people usually develop kidney disease that increases their chances of developing acute renal failure after infection. Acute renal failure is BAD news.  They may also have underlying heart conditions that decide to act up (and maybe cause a heart attack) in the presence of infection. 

**Cancer**\- These patients may be taking medications for their cancer that cause immunosuppression as a side effect, making them much more susceptible to infection and potentially limiting their ability to be healthy enough to receive chemotherapy (thus allowing their cancer to go untreated). 

**Immune system disorders-** This one explains itself.",t3_fe9i00,False,BigRedPharm,1583551577.0,1

1739,"It will depend on the duration and how well-controlled the diabetes is. People with more advanced diabetes also typically have complications such as structural kidney damage, cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and dyslipidemia, and various other vascular changes. In addition, an acute illness such as a viral infection like coronavirus does a wonderful job of throwing your blood sugars out of whack as your appetite changes, etc. This puts diabetics at an increased risk of HHS (type 2)/DKA (type 1) or hypoglycemic events. 

Bottom line is that presence of these complications in a diabetic is expected to put them at an increased risk of succumbing to the coronavirus.

Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer. 

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections are normally mild (such as the common cold, which is caused by human coronaviruses in about 15% of cases), cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known by the provisional name 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

COVID-19, as the disease will now be known, was decided on by the WHO, with the organization giving a number of reasons as to why it was chosen.

“WHO had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.

The virus is thought to have originated in the city of Wuhan in China, which led to it being frequently named the “Wuhan coronavirus,” or “Chinese coronavirus,” but neither of these were official names and some believe they may have contributed to discrimination against Chinese people.”

I’d say the masks are the most important thing. In the US there is a huge misinformation campaign to tell the general public masks are dangerous and won’t work. The US only has three weeks of PPE stockpile and is reserving supplies for medical professionals and VVIP’s.

Masks in the US are not currently being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer.

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often.

It does make sense to test people who've been exposed and people who they've been in contact with.

Like that nurse who cared for a known coronavirus patient and came down with symptoms herself.  She and everyone she's talked to since she was (probably) exposed should be tested without question.  And then when they find a case, they should repeat the process.

People presenting with symptoms should be tested without question, as well, and the.abive process should be related.

They shouldn't be testing the local hypochondriac.

But instead, some political appointees told that nurse she couldn't have it because she had PPE.  🤦🏻‍♂️ This is what happens when you hire for the loyalty of wealth, rather than demonstrated competence, and run the federal government like it's an episode of The Apprentice.

For a lot of the brands in use, the sensivity can be as low as 50 - 60% (meaning they will read negative falsely in as many as 40% - 50% of cases).  Specificity is high.  IF it reads positive, you can count on that -- you have the flu.  If it reads negative, you maybe have the flu and maybe don't.

2574,"I wouldn't say it's bad math, but an estimate based on the data from the last few weeks.  The only thing we can measure is confirmed testing, because there is no accurate way to measure actual cases.  Of course there are tons of variables - testing rate, R0, government reaction and behavioral changes, and seasonal weather changes.

But we can set some bounds and estimates based on previous outbreaks and current data compared to those previous outbreaks.

1. The ""best case"" scenario - this is a bad flu.   For the US, if we use 2017-2018 a the lower bound (for deaths) there were 45,000,000 cases of the flu 810 hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths (0.14% death rate).   [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) 
2. Worldwide cases and WHO estimates - 100,000 cases, 3400 deaths (3.4% death rate)
3. Diamond princess - 3700 passengers, 696 cases, 6 deaths (0.86% death rate)

Given the lack of a vaccine and higher hospitalization and death rates this should be worse than the flu.

Anyhow - my point in posting the numbers is that for countries that are just getting started, I had thought 2-3 weeks was the time frame for maximum fear and panic.  But for the US, April will probably be much scarier than March.

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

**Why?** Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.

Do we really think that the Diamond princess is a good conveyor of spread? How many population centers replicate the exact proximity and conditions of that ship? Densities will be a large variance and there is absolutely no population that replicates the behavior of a cruise ship, the closest I can even think of would be a college dorm.

As the virus replicates and is transmitted between people, imperfect copies are created. The mutations don't really change how the virus functions, but they do show the pattern of transmission.

Think of it like students copying homework from each other. Let's say Alex hands in some work to you. It's mostly good, but there's some weird typo. Later Bo hands in their work too...With the same typo. They probably wouldn't make the same mistake independently, so they must have gotten it from Alex. Bo also adds a new error as well. Later Casey hands in their work, with Alex's typo but not Bo's. Later still Dani submits their work, with the same typos as Bo --- so Dani must have gotten their work from Bo, not just straight from Alex.

Combine that with people here on reddit throwing around rumors and theories that are mostly pretty terrible and ""worst case"", and its so easy to get sucked into despair. 

**What I have decided for myself is the following:**

- Be prepared...not panic buying and hoarding, but making logical decisions on supplies. This can help because it's something we can actually do right now to help our families.

- I remember that there have been so many things that were said to be gigantic apocalypse-like events that turned out to be nowhere near as bad as what people feared initially. This is not to dismiss the seriousness of the situation or the fact that we just don't know a lot at this point...but situations are rarely as bad as what many people fear at the outset. Again, this doesn't mean this can't end up bad, but things very often do not work that way. This allows us to be prepared but still not overly stressed out.

- I am limiting my reddit time regarding this situation. I want to be informed, but the fact is that MANY people on reddit and on this subreddit, are throwing around theories and rumors as facts. The real fact is, no one knows much at this point. That is a little scary in and of itself, but it also means that a lot of the wild ideas flying around are just rumors/theories, EVEN those stated by doctors are at this point only suppositions. I think within the next 2 or 3 weeks we will have much better first hand information from watching cases here in the US (if you are in the US this is relevant).

- The numbers from South Korea are encouraging in my opinion. The death rate is lower, the hospitalization rates are lower, and they have not resorted to the draconian levels that China used. They have been testing 10 thousand people a day and are supposed to be pretty transparent with reporting, so their numbers give a good idea of what the reality is. My hope is that we in the US will ramp up testing in the next week or two and follow their lead. 


Just do what you can logically to prepare and try not to stress over what you have no power over...easier said than done, but that is the key. Also definitely consider talking to a counselor or someone you trust to help work through some of the anxiety - it sounds dismissive to say that but it really does help.

There is a wealth of evidence in support of metal ""plates"" in pre-colombian America. If you want things that are properly bizarre, LDS beliefs about homosexuality are supremely more fucked up and much more immediately harmful.

Similar to believing whether Moses or Jonah were literal people is irrelevant now, you could list a lot of bizarre fucked up stuff (Some fun things to read about that you might be interested in):  
Joseph's masonic heritage, the Jupiter pendant, Celestial Dynastic Marriage--which is unique from polygamy, but that too, anything Bruce R McConkie has ever said, journal of discourses, Urim and Thummim, Plurality of gods, the idea of God's Wife--as well as a race of gods, people living on the sun, Bigfoot is Cain, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam  


But any crazy really pales in comparison to harmful beliefs or gaslighting that happens on a much more subtle, and sometimes not so subtle (looking at you BYU) level. Not many people associated with the church are malicious in any way. Most of them either do or don't believe in the crazy stuff.

3965,"**Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America**

Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America is the extraction, purification and alloying of metals and metal crafting by Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European contact in the late 15th century. Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155–1936 BCE, and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would have been found in nature without need for smelting techniques and shaped into the desired form using heat and cold hammering techniques without chemically altering it by alloying it. To date ""no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America."" In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed.

4375,"In SK, they had a cult at the center of the spread, making up more than 60% of the infected. Meaning? Most infected are 20s young women, a demographic very unlikely to die frim this.

Also, this means they can trace and test easily, and catch a lot of people in their incubation period. Since Covid-19 takes about 5 days to develop symptoms and another 2 weeks to get worse, a lot of these cases just haven't reached that phase yet.

Remember, out of the ~7000 cases in SK, only ~160 has an outcome. And of them, 115 recovered and 45 dead.

Since there is limited treatment for this, early detection slows down the spreading but don't  always helps recovery. Avaluable medical assistance helps recovery.

And, those on cruise ship etc. who were asymptomatic-at-time-of-detection, often later develope symptoms. The man who dead was not the one who addmited as a critical case, that was why they were confusion regarding his gender! Anyway, people on that cruise received care upon detection, and they were health enough to enjoy a vacation. I would expect a 1~2% mortality rate, so 7~14 out of the whole ~700.

As of the cases in China. Thoes earliy mortality rate in Wuhan (~15%) was definatly higher than normal, becaus it also started blowing up in hospitals and longtime care centers. Worse, there were no treatment guidlines or knowledge of the virus at the time.

If you look at the timeline in China. They kept it quiet, which allowed ~5 million people, who were basically visitors in Wuhan, leave for home on Jan 22nd on Spring Festival Break. But the day after, on Jan 23rd, they lock Wuhan down, and asked those 5 million to self-quarantine and seek treatment.

4 million went to other parts of Hubei, the provincen where Wuhan was the capital of. 1 million went outside Wuhan.

Turns out the morality rate was very low outside of Hubei. But these people were quarantined and received free treatment if necessary. Two or three teams of top experts were avaliable per patient, because they very much wanted to learn about this virus. There never was any large  outbreak outside Hubei. So with enough testing, free healthcare, top of the line treatment, and a young pool of patients made up of collage studients and migrant workers, the mortality rate was about 1%.

And Hubei recived 13 billion Yuan (~2 billion USD) ,~40000 health care worker (making it 1 HCP per 2 patients) , thousands of ventilator (made in China during the outbreak), 2 new hospitals (built during the outbreak) and 20+ quarantine centers. Wuhan, by the way, is a port turned big healthcare town. Think Pittsburg but bigger (which is the sister city of Wuhan). So it is what an outbreak would look in such a town with the amount of resource it recived, and the mortality rate would be about 5%.

Again, we have no prof that a lot of people can STAY asymptomatic during the whole course of Covid-19. We tested large amount of healthy people in China at flu servey center, to see if they were carriers, and they were not. We traced more than 650,000 contacts. They either were virus free or they developed symptoms---some after several weeks.

So this supposed iceberg theory of  large amount of asymptomatics just has no data supporting it. 

Some good news is that South East Asia is doing better than expected, so maybe hot weather does help. And again, several HIV and Ebola (both also retro-virus) medication has shown to be some what effective against this virus. So doctors now have at least some treatment.

Containment is key because once you run out of resources, mortality rate is going to go up. Hospitals, longterm care centers, large detention centers, countries with older population and countries where people don't usually wore masks are especially vulnerable.",t3_feid8j,False,liuliwuyu,1583561418.0,2

One possible way to counter it would be to expose large amount of healthy individual in the low death rate group (ideally identifying those with higher risk of death, and exclude them) to the virus and therefore creating herd immunity (works with virus that doesn't mutate too fast too often, coronavirus likely fits the case)

&#x200B;

i.e. don't delay, but speed up the virus spread among healthy population in the low death rate group.

&#x200B;

This is likely to minimize total deaths across the globe. Basically contracting the live virus itself for the low risk group is equivalent to a relatively speaking higher risk vaccine.

&#x200B;

Quarantine at this stage is futile. You end up with tail cases from other country to start another round of outbreak.

I get the coronavirus is bad, but this chart is irrelevant data to compare to each other side by side.

One thing: the flu vaccine is administered to most children at a young age and they’ve had many ((many many)) days to develop an immunity.

To compare that last statement to today’s data,
1) the flu now compared to an outbreak is not comparable because we are medically prepared for the flu
2) vaccines take time for the recipient to actually develop an immunity to the vaccine
3)  there are more factors giving the corona an advantage to the flu with rate of spread and asymptomatic spread.
But we are more medically advanced. 

An immunity is not likely to occur during the next year or two. To develop a vaccine, they have to have test trials on an agent infected, and there are many variables and factors, and the vaccine has to be good to go without a doubt to be administered to 100s of millions.

There is one FAQ on that page that answers the question, but I'm not going to quote it, because the key part of the answer is that **there is little information at this time**.

I had asthma as a child.  When I was sick with the cold/flu, it was always far more serious with me than with others.  Having breathing issues from asthma makes dealing with breathing issues from being sick that much worse.

I outgrew my asthma... either through environmental changes, exercise, or whatever, and now I'm in great physical shape for someone my age.  I've done triathlons and marathons, and hiked all the way across Switzerland.  Still though, when I get sick, it hits me harder than most people... I think.

If FLU in Germany right now has a 17% hospitalization rate you don't have FLU, you already have COVID-19. What is your source, it sounds WAY off.

In America:

"" CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010. ""

To calculate that for you, if it was 9,000,000 infections with 140,000 hospitalizations,  that is a 1.5% hospitalization rate.

Another example. CDC estimates   35,520,883 cases of flu in America this year and  490,561 hospitalized. That's a 1.4% hospitalization rate. Many hospitals are struggling to even handle our current flu patients, so imagine when COVID with a 10-20% hospitalization rate (5x-10x flu) come through, and they are coming en mass because the virus is more infectious, and they aren't leaving as fast as flu patients.

So in other words, if Germany really does have 17% hospitalization rate from flu rn now, yall either misdiagnosing COVID patients as flu patients or there two deadly illnesses going around there, because the highest hospitalization rate I could find for flu in America in the last 10 years (if you don't believe me look at the CDC link I shared) was 2014-2015 and it was a 1.9% hospitalization rate.",t3_feid8j,False,_WHOcaresAboutYou_,1583546888.0,8

With exponential growth of infections, these can artificially suppress the mortality rate by a lot.

 If you take only the deaths versus the number of recovered patients, you get a much higher rate of 20+%. This is obviously overshooting, since it's usually faster to die of a disease than to recover. However, the discrepancy between 0.6% and 20+% really shows that it's too early to tell.

|:-|:-|:-|

COVID-19, however, appears to have a MUCH higher hospitalization rate than the flu, according to the WHO:

>Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). ([Source](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

So it appears that we're dealing with a 1.38% flu hospitalization rate vs a 19.9%+ COVID-19 hospitalization rate (of known cases). Unless we're missing a huuuuuuge swath of unknown COVID-19 cases, I think the data appears to be pretty accurate. And this is what the WHO has to say on the rate of asymptomatic cases:

>Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.

I think the closest we will get to a controlled experiment will be the final results from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Every one of those passengers was tested so we know the ratio of mild to severe cases and over time the ultimate CFR will be determined. Probably a bit too early to know what it will be as some people only tested positive at the end of February so there will be a bit of lag to final outcomes. Out of 4,061 tested 705 were infected (including 392 asymptomatic cases at the time they tested positive - some of these may have since developed symptoms.) Of the 705 total infected 7 have died. The main problem with extrapolating from this data is the skewed demographics of cruise passengers but I suspect that for a similar cohort this will be quite representative of the severity of the disease in a best case scenario. All of these patients likely would have access to good medical care and most will have had very early medical interventions that would not be the case for someone showing up in an ER with severe symptoms already.

The R0 value of the flu is 2-3 and the R0 of COVID is showing as between 1.4 - 3.8. 

Now think about when the flu is in your area and you know several people that have gotten it. I bet you probably didn't.

Just take some precautions and realize that the vast majority of cases have relatively mild illness. Not going to say that it won't be miserable, but the chances of you ending up in the hospital are pretty small unless you have some kind of pre-existing condition.

Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.

See, just before they were making things more ridiculous than they have to be, they were making things far less ridiculous than they already are. The problem is that the public discourse seems to recognize only two extremes: ""it's just the flu"" and ""we're all gonna die, kill your way to the toilet paper"".

And so everyone is shoved in one of those two extremes, all subtlety is lost. Case in point:

> We don’t lose our shit over extremely bad cases of the Normal flu... because the deaths and everything going on appear to be EXTREMELY Similar.

You cover the ground above very compactly. Two options ""we lose our shit"" or ""it's very similar to bad flu"". How about neither? Cautious doesn't mean ""panicked"". But also ""hope"" through ignorance of facts we do know is not a strategy.

> But shutting down schools, cities, events, etc. is extreme overkill at this point.

I can't disagree more. First of all, shutting down schools, events, planned (non-critical) surgeries are normal epidemic measures which are applied every year precisely for regular flu. If officials didn't do that, the ""Normal flu"" would be worse than it already is.

These measures have to be PROACTIVE in order to be effective. We actually have hard data on this, including at 1918 for cities which thought ""it won't come to us"" or ""it's just the flu"" (didn't close schools etc.: high death rate), vs. those who knew what's about to happen and closed them early (over twice lower death rate).

And even if we can't pinpoint the exact numbers on COVID-19, we know it does a whole lot more than regular flu strains. Including things like infecting your nervous system, kidneys, heart, causing blood clotting and infarctions, and being extremely infectious during a long incubation period.

Even in South Korea which seems to test every living thing under the sun, COVID-19 has 6 times higher mortality than the flu, and the vast majority of people haven't recovered yet (means from the same sample of infected people, more will die).

This is about being informed and appropriate in our actions. While politicians are explaining their pseudo-intellectual B.S. about how it's all about the economy, leaving this virus unchecked due to lax measures will not only kill and permanently damage untold number of people more, but also screw up the economy even worse in the end.",t3_feid8j,False,LogicUpgrade,1583540954.0,2
5006,"What? This virus has a death rate of around 3.4%. Even if we assume that's a little high and it's actually only 1%, then if everyone in the United States got infected, that would be 3.5 MILLION people dead. Even if we assume that, without any quarantine or change in behavior whatsoever, the virus only infects 10% of the population (a very optimistic estimate, because swine flu in 2008 infected 20% of the globe and older patients had some degree of pre-existing immunity), that's still 350 THOUSANDS DEATHS in the United States.

I mean, even if this truly was the apocalypse, do some of these people think they’re gonna be able to survive eating just spam and rice? There’s a sign posted at my local Costco, limit of 5 cases; each case with 8 cans of spam. In the brochure they send out, it’s down to limit of 4. That suggests a widespread and collective hoarding of spam. 

Even without the time to rationalize and prioritize though, right next to the spam and rice in their respective aisle, are usually entire aisle fulls of other canned goods and sauces, and pasta and dried snack foods. 

But people also definitely wouldn’t need to be irrationally hoarding if those who have the ability and / or the responsibility to have acted on this before we got to where we are now, did the responsible thing. Everyone from mainstream media outlets, CDC and WHO, leaders in governments around the world and especially China, are complicit in the spread of this virus. 

The whole situation feels like a widespread issue of too many people not looking for information that doesn’t affect them immediately and outside their bubble, plus putting too much trust in government and authority figures and both having too much complacency. Then overreacting when it’s too late. 

My parents are just like this and I worry for them.

I have no idea if spam is sold out here. I didn't look for spam, because I've never eaten spam in my life and I'm not going to start now. If I ever eat spam, it will be cooked by someone who knows what to do with it.

There could be plenty of people who are still asymptomatic or are experiencing a milder case of COVID-19, who simply have not been tested yet, either because they haven't thought to go in for testing, because local governments have been encouraging people to stay at home unless your doctor requests you get tested, or because their local docs don't have enough testing equipment yet.

He was sick a few days later with cough and fever but not sick enough for hospitalization and the local health department refused to screen him. 

He was evaluated in the hospital and we felt testing was warranted. The local health department initially refused because while he was febrile, coughing and had returned from a high risk area he wasn’t short of breath so he didn’t meet the case definition. 

After some back and forth they ultimately acquiesced and agreed to testing. The next day they told us the state health department had cancelled the test.

Law of small numbers says you will have extremes.    Could be big.  Could be small.  We need a larger sample space of confirmed cases to get a more accurate CFR.  And in the end, with community spread the rates will be much lower.   And probably different than China.  And China will be different than other countries.  

That’s partially because of demographics.   Countries with older populations, obesity, social customs that exacerbate community spread, poor public health systems will have higher overall CFRs.   

Another reason is that at the beginning of any local outbreak the most sickly present first.   So there is a wave of critical patients.   Over time, the number of non critical patients gets identified.   

So it’s a numbers game.   The first patient to show up with a novel disease either lives or dies.  If they die the CFR is 100%.  If they live it’s 0%.   The next patient shows up - and same outcomes.  So now the rate can be 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100%.   Depends on the permutations.    

It could easily happen that the first 99 patients identified all live and the next one dies.  CFR is 1%.   Then the next 99 die.   CFR 50%.  

Again.  Sample space too small.   We know what the CFR is with the flu.  And using CFR by country for the flu will give a pretty good estimate of which countries have a solid public health system.

We've been working with the folks in Washington who made the tests up there. Honestly the west coast is trying as best as they can with NO FUCKING SUPPORT FROM OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. Mike Pence is just sitting on his ass. The CDC is trying to get their funding, but it might honestly be too late. 

The spread might be worse up here in NorCal than we even understand because *this virus has a spread ratio of one person infecting an estimated four people.* Do the math. Compared to the standard flu, which is 1 person to maybe 1.5 people, Corvid-19 gets FOUR PEOPLE. And it's insanely transmittable. So those four people can go infect four more people in their lives. Wait maybe a few days, two weeks at the most and BOOM you got Coronavirus on your hands and you're probably beginning to panic. You got it; who gave it to you?

[https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020)

Flu: symptoms appear within 1 day of catching it. Corona Virus: Symptoms appear 1 to 14 days after catching it. That means you may spread it for a week or two before you even know you're sick.

Flu: survives on surfaces for 1 day. Corona virus: survives on surfaces for 9 days. That means if someone with the flu uses a gas pump, that pump is safe to use a day later. If someone with corona virus uses a pump, it's still infecting people more than a week later, meaning a single person has far more opportunities to infect others with corona virus than with the flu.

source for the 9 days claim: [https://www.ktvu.com/news/covid-19-more-contagious-than-sars-or-mers-can-live-on-surfaces-for-up-to-9-days-studies-say](https://www.ktvu.com/news/covid-19-more-contagious-than-sars-or-mers-can-live-on-surfaces-for-up-to-9-days-studies-say)

Flu: Has a vaccine. Corona virus: Doesn't. You can take preventative medical measures to protect yourself from flu exposure, but you can't with corona virus.

Flu: affects young and old similarly (though more deadly to infants and the elderly). Corona virus: does not appear to affect young people much at all (no one under 10 has died yet, most are asymptomatic), but is far deadlier to the elderly (20% mortality rate above age 80). This makes children a vector for transmission as they may have a little sniffle that wouldn't keep them home from school most of the time, but is deadly to older folks.

You're reading your own source incorrectly. using the top range numbers, 61,000 deaths out of 45,000,000 illnesses is approximately 0.1%. The bottom range numbers give a comparable average. If you intended to say covid19 was less dangerous, well, you shouldn't have linked to a page about the flu.

This is true. All numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. The 2% was taken from the CDC several days ago. They recently released a new number saying it's a 3.4% mortality rate, which is even worse. I don't trust that number, however, because other nations have reported near 2%.

The lack of universal healthcare means people only go to the doctor if they really need to.

This is why you get a PCP that you can contact and talk to and they can help you sort out if you should go to the hospital.  
  
It will keep people like thenationalblade, who doesn't seem to understand the difference between tests and treatments, from wasting medical-staff's time.

0.027% of the American population died from influenza in 17/18

VS

0.0043% of Canadians.

As for Canada’s population being so widely dispersed... majority of the population lives in urban areas, close to the border. Hell man, more than half of the country lives in Ontario and Quebec. 

Population density in our major cities and the vast suburban communities that surround them isn’t too much different than that of our American counterparts. 

A quick comparison of Chicago (a smaller city) to Toronto: 10,000 people per square mile for Chicago, and 4200 people per square kilometre for Toronto. So to adjust for measurement that puts Toronto at about 7000-7500 people per square mile.

I have two internet providers. I use a Bell cellular device for high speed (I commonly get 70 Mbps up/down) and I have crap DSL from TekSavvy. I usually get about 1.5 Mpbs down, shit for up.

Crap DSL is about $70 a month, unlimited. It works almost well enough for youtube/netflix/prime. It can be a little slow to start streaming, but it's ok.

I use the Bell account for work because I work remotely and it isn't uncommon to be in video meetings. I also have a VoIP desk phone and remote into servers and things. This is billed on a tiered system. I usually use 30-40 gb of data and this costs around $110-130 a month.

I also have 10gb download on my mobile phone plan (also through Bell) so I route things like my laptop through that until I use up 9gb.

I did have a satellite system for a month through Xplorenet. Download was pretty good but it was somewhat expensive overall. Much more than the Bell setup. The latency was pretty bad so there's a bit of a lag between requesting a site and receiving it. I didn't care for it.

It is a bit of an adjustment since my previous house had fiber and could easily hit 130 Mbps up/down for about $70 a month.

If you're looking at the current numbers as they stand now and extrapolating that linearly into the future then you are not listening to experts opinion either, you're doing the very thing you're complaining about. Raw data is not an opinion, any projections *you* make from that data is *your opinion,* not an experts. If you look at ebola, h1n1, etc numbers early on and make a linear projection from that you'd end up with a MUCH worse outcome than what actually happened as well. 

What most experts are saying now is essentially that we *don't know*. There's not enough data to make accurate long term predictions.

That being said, the promoters have either been naive or just stubborn in their attitude about this.

Those lawsuits may have gone nowhere, but they'ed still have to pay their own lawyers to fight them off and in the court of public opinion they would have been screwed.

Instead of trying to double down by bringing in replacement headliners and insisting for the event to go on, they should have been giving local businesses a heads up and made plans to postpone, hopefully just delaying revenue.

Edit: slight rant incoming;

I'm still bewildered by the overall public response in the United States... Do we think that we are genetically different from the Chinese and we will have some magical immunity to stop this virus from spreading...err... virally ? 

Obviously we won't be able to tightly quarantine millions of people like China... but is the only alternative to this simply ""wash your hands"", keep granny inside, don't panic and definitely don't wear masks ? 

I don't feel panicked whatsoever, I feel a bit frustrated and embarrassed at our national avoidance of pragmatism. 

Why are we still trying to avoid canceling events if at all possible ? Why are people acting like it some kind of sign of defeat ?  

It should be looked at as completely the opposite.... preventatively canceling large gatherings is actual real effort at slowing the spread, it's the responsible thing to do. 

We are being incredibly arrogant, especially compared to the efforts that China and Japan etc have been making.   

Countries aren't hermetically sealed containers, if the population of the  United States does little to slow the spread, this makes it that much harder for every other country to do so well... 

Imagine you and everyone in your city has been quarantined for days, everyone in public is wearing is wearing masks and taking precautions..... then you turn on TV and see footage from the United States... crowds of unmasked people in a city as if they are living on a seperate planet.

What I am stating is that claiming the CDC guidelines are 'the bare minimum' is wrong, the guidelines are a measured, research based response taking advice from experts in infection control.

My concern is that people are listening to news outlets and hearing reports that are scaring them into behaving emotionally and irrationally about the situation because the reader/listener/viewer does not have the expertise to understand the facts without context.

As an example, on your point about mortality rates:

Comparing the mortality rates of seasonal flu and Covid-19 is not a useful measure. Worldwide recording of data about flu mortality has been captured for decades and we can make a reasonably accurate assumption here, however Covid-19 has existed for a couple months and we know nearly nothing about it because it's still being researched.

In your own post you report that a 3.4% global mortality and 5% US mortality, I've not checked this data, but one reason this number is so different is because we don't have enough data right now to make any kind of accurate estimation.

What we do know is that some people get the virus and are asymptomatic, or have very mild symptoms that would not necessarily lead them to think they had Covid-19. These people therefore don't get tested, treated or recorded as having survived Covid-19, this inflates the mortality rate higher than the reality of the situation.

A solution to this would be to do a large scale study of a sample population of people, however this isn't possible now because the virus is currently still actively spreading and this is the first few months of the virus' life.

If it were to become another worldwide seasonal disease like flu then scientists could study a population of people over a period of a year and publish findings from that, but this hasn't happened yet so any mortality data is purely a snapshot of those who were tested for Covid-19 and then died.

From this same data you could without context and understanding claim that 5% of people are dying from the test in the US and that the test is more lethal in the US than the rest of the world, but thats obviously nonsense and not true.

Look, I am worried too. I am not an expert either. But I refuse to allow the media to terrify me, I know I need to trust my government (in the UK) and analyse what everyone is telling me.

I agree that 3,000 in 100,000 would be an awful death toll, but 200 in 100,000 is too and thats based on the flu figure you wrote, and we do not actually know if these figures are accurate yet.

7880,"It's an interesting problem to consider.

There are two major problems to tackle, the first is extracting audio/visual information from the test machine without tripping the security software or alerting the proctor. The second is getting the correct answer info back to the test-taker without alerting the proctor or their software.

For extracting audio/visual information, it's preferable to avoid tampering with the software entirely, on the assumption that the security software can do a fairly deep system inspection. You might be able to get away with a kernel rootkit or hypervisor rootkit masking some software, but it's an unnecessary risk. The cheapest way to get A/V out of the test environment would be a well-positioned pinhole camera, and a cheap audio bug. The fanciest way to do it that I can think of would be a laser mic and a TEMPEST setup or optical eavesdropping.

Once you've got the A/V out to the assistant, you need to get the assistant's answer back to the test-taker. Since line of sight is fairly tightly policed, you need to either get the signal back in a non-visible manner, or signal from very close to the natural sight line for the monitor. On the non-visible side of things, you can buy cell phone buzzer motors for pennies. Sufficiently muffled, and run at a low intensity and frequency, it could be used for morse code or pre-arranged code sequences depending on the answer type.

For visible options, you need to work within the line of sight constraints, which means the signal has to be very near to the monitor. If the computer is privately-owned, well-executed bezel modifications to install a small LED or strip of LEDs resembling typical status feedback lights would provide a channel for simple morse or pre-arranged codes. For school-provided computers, a low-powered laser, such as a laser pointer, placed well outside the camera's field of view, projecting onto the wall just above the monitor bezel would provide a similar single bit data channel. Of course, for a fancier, easier to use approach one could use the same oblique projection method, but construct a laser projector to output a text line just above the monitor bezel.

No matter which approach is chosen, the extraction and injection components of the cheat would need their own wireless communication system, and likely power system as well, which imposes some restrictions on their minimum size, plausible location and disguises, and viable running time.

----

From a technical perspective, it's absolutely possible to defeat the safeguards in place. However, they succeed in making the necessary prep work and setup to bypass them at least as arduous as simply learning the material and taking the test honestly.

7911,"I can see how you could make like, a STEM final or something 10 times more difficult than an in class final, or so hard that cheating can’t help. But for other areas of study it would be basically impossible.  

For example, I’m a Political Science major and for most of my classes there’s no way they could do that. Last semester I took 5 classes, 2 of which did not have final exams.   

For the ones that did, there’s no way to make an international relations, first-level Spanish, or public policy final 10 times harder than in class or so hard that cheating can’t help. The finals already covered damn near everything we learned in class and they were easy enough.    

This semester I’m taking 6 classes, and again 2 don’t have final exams. I am taking Microeconomics and a Logic course which are more or less STEM classes and the only ones that could actually have horrific take home finals. But it would be pointless because it wouldn’t be like “solve the n body problem” or some crazy hard math shit. It would be “calculate the dead weight loss for the following 100 supply and demand curves” or “define this list of all 300 terms and concepts we learned in class” or “construct a truth table for this TFL argument which contains 10 variables” or “make proofs for the following 200 arguments”.   

Yeah, sure, that would be hard as fuck but cheating would still help tons and at some point it just becomes tedious shitty busy work. You’re not actually being tested and cheating hasn’t been deterred or rendered ineffective, you’re just being punished for no reason.   

And before you say I go to a shitty university with shitty professors, I go to the most prestigious university in my state, it is one of the very best for my major in the country, and the faculty here (especially in my college), are some of the most influential and well known experts in their fields.

7948,"As unpopular as this may end up being, I'm hoping that all the passengers/crew will be taken off of the ship and put into isolation/quarantine on land, since it appears that cruise ships are either unable to prevent transmission of COVID-19 through HVAC/ventilation systems, or that there is another systematic problem/issue that makes isolation/quarantine on cruise ships ineffective.  

The thing is that anywhere the ship ends up going, is going to have some kind of impact, since I'm not thinking that there are any military ports/facilities left that can handle the numbers of personnel involved, which would reduce the NIMBY factor.  

Mare Island, Port Charles, Alameda, Treasure Island, none really look that good to me, unless an on-ship quarantine is planned.

Hunters Point Shipyard, looks pretty empty/unused, and looks to have space to support a large tent city if that's the approach taken for a off-ship quarantine.

In any case, hopefully the ship has implemented effective isolation/quarantine procedures, to hopefully have a lower infection rate than the Diamond Princess.  I also hope that the US does a far better job than Japan apparently did when the Grand Princess is eventually allowed to dock and hopefully start the process of getting those who are sick/infected proper care and treatment.  And to get those who are not sick/infected, tested, isolated/quarantined to get them cleared so that they can move on with their lives.

Just my thoughts and observations, and as a lay person, my thoughts may be totally wrong.  But as concerned as I am about COVID-19, that concern (fear) won't make me take us vs them type attitude, and say or suggest things that are good for me, but comes at a potentially high cost for others.  Keeping the ship out of port without sufficient support is simply wrong, empathy is something that all of us should be having/showing/using when looking at COVID-19 and pretty much everything else that goes on around the world.

Alan Smithee (also Allen Smithee) is an official pseudonym used by film directors who wish to disown a project. Coined in 1968 and used until it was formally discontinued in 2000, it was the sole pseudonym used by members of the Directors Guild of America (DGA) when a director, dissatisfied with the final product, proved to the satisfaction of a guild panel that they had not been able to exercise creative control over a film. The director was also required by guild rules not to discuss the circumstances leading to the movie or even to acknowledge being the project's director.

8698,"Agree with the sentiment in this thread.   Last night I couldn’t sleep because I kept going through the scenario that I hope we avoid in my head.  We’re not going to avoid it without major travel restrictions and quarantines.  I’m a RN. 

From what I understand, we’re about a week or two away from what’s happening in italy.   We have about the same capacity in our medical system.  

If you consider that this virus has a much higher mortality rate than the flu, and that about 10-20% of people require hospitalization, you quickly realize that we do not have nearly enough hospital beds to help everyone.  

Let’s run some numbers.  

We have 2-3 hospital beds available for every 1000 people on average in the US.  If we have 1000 ppl who are positive for the virus (easily the case in Seattle) 100-200 ppl could require hospitalization.  Let’s say there are 10,000 hospital beds available for a city of about 3.5 million.  That’s a rough estimate. 

Only a very small percentage of these rooms are the kind of negative pressure rooms that we require to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the hospital.  Some hospitals only have 2-3 some have 10 — for the entire hospital.  Hundreds of people requiring hospitalization at the same time would undoubtedly overload the system.  So the hospitals have very low capacity to handle this virus because patients often end up needing very specialized rooms.  It seems like they are at a threshold now, where unless they contain it like yesterday, they will end up in a situation where there are no beds left for anyone.  

Let’s say 1000 ppl are infected now (likely an underestimate) we can expect 100-200 hospitalizations...and the caseload seems to double every 1-3 days.  So by Monday they could need 200-400 additional hospital beds.  And it gets worse because those first 100-200 patients who were hospitalized didn’t just get up and walk out of the icu after being on a ventilator.  You have to account for the fact that you already have 100 people hospitalized who won’t vacate those beds for a while.  So on Monday maybe they need 300-600 beds available.  And they need the staff to care for these people, and they need testing available for the staff and the protective equipment and you can see how this snowballs into a completely horrifying disaster.  

If we don’t stop it from spreading, how many days until we overload the hospital system?  

It’s not going to take very long.  Especially with the outbreaks occurring in nursing homes where infection prevention is basically impossible.",t3_fehy27,False,rninco,1583551240.0,2

8833,"The thing that has governments and hospitals so concerned over is the exponential growth curve. 

Most people can visualize linear growth but not exponential growth. 

For example: 

Let’s say you have a jar with two bacteria. The bacteria population doubles every minute and it will take exactly 24 hours to fill the jar... 

About 90% of the jar will suddenly fill up in the last few minutes. 

After 23 hours and 55 minutes have passed, the jar will still only be 1/16 full which still seems pretty empty. 

But as that doubles again and again over the next 5 minutes the jar will be COMPLETELY full. 

In the last minute, the jar will go from being 1/2 full to completely full... So as much growth happens in the last minute as the previous 23 hours and 59 minutes combined. 

Currently the number of cases outside of China is tripling every week. 

Cities are expected to go through this type of growth where all of a sudden tens of thousands of people get really sick all at once and it totally overwhelms the hospitals. 

This is what happened in Wuhan. It’s expected to happen in other cities once the virus reaches a critical mass in those communities. 

Even if it’s no more deadly than the flu, it will still cause a massive disruption if 15% of a large population center with millions of people suddenly get pneumonia all at once. 

The % of the population who die from this is currently about 2% but it goes WAY up if the hospitals are swamped and the old folks with pneumonia can’t receive treatment.",t3_fehy27,False,AirBacon,1583531980.0,23

Everyone needs to act like it could be anywhere and if you have a persistent cough, especially with a fever, avoid being around other people as much as possible, wear some sort of mask whenever in public (but avoid going in public as much as you can). Wash your hands as much as possible, use hand sanitizer or some other means of disinfecting your hands when you can't. Avoid large crowds and standing / walking close to people. If anyone coughs where you are, stay far from them and do not walk in the area they coughed for a few minutes as contaminated droplets could be lingering in the air. Anything you buy at a store could be contaminated so clean/disinfect stuff you bring in. Your shoes may be contaminated so disinfect the soles before walking in your home / apartment or take them off at the entrance.

He also points out if you're in a lower risk group, you should not selfishly think you're fine and do things that could infect others. You're still at higher risk than with the flu but more importantly, your carelessness around a high risk person could lead to their death. I think this also applies to joking around about it (""let me impress my buddies / Youtube fans by fake coughing onto people lol"") or trying to prove you're a tough guy or how much of an asshole you are by coughing into the open air at or around others.

8837,"The main reason is because of the fatality rate, and total deaths. The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.

1) Fatality rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential. 

2) Influenza is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no official treatment, it's done case-by-case. 

As a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating.",t3_fehy27,True,One_Curious_Jay,1583540373.0,6

>The plague killed a greater proportion of the world’s population at that time, but it took nearly a century to kill the same number as the 1918 flu did in about 15 months.

Case-fatality rate is not as big of a problem as spread rate. It doesn't matter if 90% of patients die from a virus if it only spreads to one other person at a time, or has an inefficient method of spread.

On the other hand if you have a 2% fatality rate and the virus can spread world-wide, it's impossible to contain and therefore is likely to result in more deaths overall.

There's a difference between a respirator and a mask, which is where the confusion is coming from. N95 ""masks"" are respirators with filters. Surgical masks don't work at filtering, they act as a barrier.

>The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like Ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.  
>  
>1) Fatality  rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds  counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were  actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading  to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to  be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with  contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than  someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a  more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it  infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that  it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential.  
>  
>2) Influenza  is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats  touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses  themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so  fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality  rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but  either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't  have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no  official treatment, it's done case-by-case.  
>  
>As  a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible  vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not  as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread  (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating.",t3_fehy27,True,One_Curious_Jay,1583540468.0,2

People die from Ebola so fast that the contamination comes either through fecal matter or through proximity to the body/incapacitated individual.

In contrast to this, COVID-19 spreads more similarly to influenza, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. Given the existing statistics for the number of people that die from influenza each year (with anti-virals and a vaccine), the fear comes from the potential number of deaths that will come from this virus given how much more fatal it is than influenza.

Any school closures have so far been made by those individual schools despite government advice to remain open.

Expanding the NHS capacity is obviously amazingly important. But even then we're not going to be able to hospitalise everyone who needs it, especially not all those who need intensive care. I was under the impression that's why these first two phases were so important. Contain and delay to spread out the load on the NHS and at least try and stop our health system from becoming crippled.

But so far, no school or university closures, not even an official recommendation to work from home where possible. Everyone, employers and schools, are waiting on some action to fall in line behind.

9146,"The reason why it's so concerning imo is that we've had vaccines for influenza since 1938. The only real figure we have to go by in any recent time is the Spanish Flu in 1918. Obviously there are issues with this comparison as there are many factors that increased the fatality of the virus at that time (World War 1). That being said, the rate of spread for COVID-19 is actually higher than Spanish Flu.

Realistically I would say that the best way to view it would be between the figures of Spanish Flu and current Influenza. Given how it spreads in a similar way to Influenza, I think the comparison is fair as long as the differences in fatality rate and symptoms are considered. The main thing is that a lot more people are able to be infected by COVID-19 than they are by influenza, and herd immunity plays a large part in that. Dealing with a virus that spreads rapidly where literally nobody is actually immune is not something we've had to deal with in recent times.",t3_fehy27,True,One_Curious_Jay,1583541294.0,9

What this doesn't account for are differences in the way viruses are transmitted generally. COVID-19 acts more like Influenza in the way it is spread.

>To infect a cell, coronaviruses use a ‘spike’ protein that binds to  the cell membrane, a process that's activated by specific cell enzymes.  Genomic analyses of the new coronavirus have revealed that its spike  protein differs from those of close relatives, and suggest that the  protein has a site on it which is activated by a host-cell enzyme called furin.  
>  
>This is significant because furin is found in lots of  human tissues, including the lungs, liver and small intestines, which  means that the virus has the potential to attack multiple organs, says  Li Hua, a structural biologist at Huazhong University of Science and  Technology in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. The finding could  explain some of the symptoms observed in people with the coronavirus,  such as liver failure, says Li, who co-authored a genetic analysis of  the virus that was posted on the ChinaXiv preprint server on 23 February. SARS and other coronaviruses in the same genus as the new virus don't have furin activation sites, he says.  
>  
>The furin activation site “sets the virus up very differently to SARS in  terms of its entry into cells, and possibly affects virus stability and  hence transmission”, says Gary Whittaker, a virologist at Cornell  University in Ithaca, New York. His team published another structural  analysis of the coronavirus’s spike protein on bioRxiv on 18 February.  
>  
>Several other groups have also identified [the activation site](http://virological.org/t/the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2/398) as possibly enabling the virus to spread efficiently between humans. They note that these sites are also found in other viruses that spread  easily between people, including severe strains of the influenza virus.  On these viruses, the activation site is found on a protein called  haemagglutinin, not on the spike protein.

>The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like Ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.  
>  
>1) Fatality rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds  counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were  actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading  to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to  be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with  contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than  someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a  more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it  infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that  it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential.  
>  
>2) Influenza  is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats  touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses  themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so  fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality  rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but  either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't  have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no  official treatment, it's done case-by-case.  
>  
>As  a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand  that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth  statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible  vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not  as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread  (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating.",t3_fehy27,True,One_Curious_Jay,1583544992.0,1

Young people are also quite able to be infected, they are just less likely to die from the infection. This can be seen if you look at the cases of university students being infected, or in the South Korean cult where 40% of infected were in their 20s. 

Panic has been seen to be better in the short-term at the early stages of pandemic, as it means that when people do calm down they are alert and focused on resolving the issue.

The hemorrhagic features are described in detail in the book. Bleeding out the ears, nose, eyes, rectum were common.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/)

*Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, “One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred” (*[*Ireland, 1928*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 57). A German investigator recorded “hemorrhages occurring in different parts of the interior of the eye” with great frequency (*[*Thomson and Thomson, 1934b*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*). An American pathologist noted: “Fifty cases of subconjunctival hemorrhage were counted. Twelve had a true hemotypsis, bright red blood with no admixture of mucus…. Three cases had intestinal hemorrhage” (*[*Ireland, 1928*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 13). The New York City Health Department's chief pathologist said, “Cases with intense pain look and act like cases of dengue … hemorrhage from nose or bronchi … paresis or paralysis of either cerebral or spinal origin … impairment of motion may be severe or mild, permanent or temporary … physical and mental depression. Intense and protracted prostration led to hysteria, melancholia, and insanity with suicidal intent” (*[*Jordon, 1927*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 265).*",t3_fehy27,False,wadenelsonredditor,1583557257.0,6

>Experiments in manipulating viral genomes are ""now routine,"" writes Mae-Wan Ho. ""It shows how easy it is to create new viruses that jump host species in the laboratory, in the course of apparently legitimate experiments in genetic engineering. Similar experiments could be happening in nature when no one is looking, as the SARS and many other epidemics amply demonstrate.""

>In other words, continues Mae-Wan Ho, ""geneticists can now greatly speed up evolution in the laboratory to create viruses and bacteria that have never existed in all the billions of years of evolution on earth.""

Also relevant parts from her [HuffPost interview](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6944450):
>Suzan Mazur: How does the current attention to viruses and viroids throw a further wrench into the Modern Synthesis?

>Mae-Wan Ho: A long time ago Howard Temin already proposed that the viruses -- our genomes are full of viruses -- so there's a theory that they are remnants of past infections, etc. The other theory that Howard Temin has is -- well maybe they actually had functions in cells. And maybe viruses were like the transposons that escaped.

>Mae-Wan Ho: I’ve written a paper called “[The New Genetics and Natural versus Artificial Genetic Modification](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/11/4748).” The thing is, if you look at an ordinary organism, our cells actually make their genome quite stable and they divide or not, as needed. They don’t actually multiply out of control. 

>So cancer is a disease of communication. When the organism loses its coherence, then you get cancer. [Harry Rubin's work](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/02/07/virus-expert-and-cancer-biologist-harry-rubin-dies-at-93/) on this is especially interesting. He discovered that if you take the cells out of the body and grow them in culture, then they mutate all over the place. Their genomes are not stable. You need a holistic integrity to keep genomes stable. Otherwise, they aren’t.

""The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and **the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6.** We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective  ""

*Collectivistics* have been assumed to *possess more self-control than individualistics*, which was supported when self-control was measured *by behavioral but not by attitudinal measure*. One plausible reason may be because although Easterners make favorable self-evaluations, it is not as prevalent and explicit as U.S. individuals. In the current study, U.S. participants might rate themselves to have higher self-control to give others a good impression, but this self-enhancement strategy is not usually used in Chinese context. However, Chinese participants indeed showed higher behavioral self-control than U.S. counterparts. This may reflect *Chinese participants’ long-term exercise of inhibition / suppression ability*.

Moreover, no interaction effect between country and individual-level individualism and collectivism was found, in consistent with recent research which discloses that *family allocentrism, one’s allocentric orientation towards family, was related to better (attitudinal) self-control in both Chinese and Italian adolescents with equal magnitude*.

There have also been cases of people showing no symptoms for as long as 24 days. There are literally infected people walking around shedding the virus and they have no idea.

Unfortunately, not so much. The thing about the R0 of the flu was from a Reddit comment. Of course, if you look at the chart of flu cases during flu season and after, it’s very obvious that the R0 is very different in winter and in summer, and that it’s obviously not just 1.3 in winter. I spent a significant time trying to find confirmation, but couldn't come up with anything.

As for the secondary attack rate, I heard that in a podcast. Upon looking it up, I got this result:

> H1N1 appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. The secondary attack rate of seasonal influenza ranges from 5% to 15%. Current estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22% to 33%.

https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/assess/disease_swineflu_assess_20090511/en/

As for Covid-10, you get anything from 2% to 15%. I heard a German epidemiologist say that if he had to pull a number out of his ass (well he didn’t actually put it that way) it’d be 10-15% based on the various data.

A lot depends on sources. For example, I noticed the two studies you linked in support of secondary attack rate are pre-print and early release.

understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza.
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2

I am....concerned....that administrators are making conflicting decisions throughout the world about what the protocols for dealing with this virus are.   Masks are not useful.  Masks are very useful.  No need for a mask.  You need a mask before you come to the ER.   Most people will be fine.  18% of people are seriously ill and 6-7% need ICU   This is just like the flu.  This is 20x worse than the flu.  You’ll be fine, don’t panic.   You need to prepare for quarantine.  Most people will go to work.  You need to stay home.  We have the best medical system in the world.  We only have RICU ventilators for around 10% more adults because of flu season so good luck if you need oxygen.  

WTF!!!!!   

We need a single clear policy, worldwide.   If country A applies it but country B ignores it, then Country A gets it again.   If you follow basic social distancing protocols but your neighbor is out at a concert - then what’s the point of your compliant effort?  You would have to hunker down in quarantine for the next 18 months.  And if you’re 55 or older - that’s likely the safest thing to do because COVID19 is a Boomer Doomer.  

Kept my son home from pre-K yesterday because the douche bags at the school think it’s ok for him to get packed on a bus, go visit a university with 5 other schools and listen to a concert.   Meanwhile Positive COVID cases in metro area are being announced.  Next week is grandparents day!   Great!   Let’s put the most vulnerable population in the same room as the most non compliant hand washers and most active vectors.  

And this horse shit that the kids will be fine.  Great.  One big less thing to worry about.    But my little rug rats are the dirtiest germ rags around and act as the vector to give me and their grandma the virus.   So yeah...let’s keep in school.  Cause they never spit or sneeze on adults.  Ever.   How can people be this stupid????    Lock down the schools now.   Limit the schools from mixing.  No more games.  No more sporting events.  Pare it down to essential gatherings only.   

I am BEWILDERED at the lack of even modest efforts to immediately implement basic social distancing throughout the country NOW.  TODAY.  It costs NOTHING to not have grandparents day or cancel a field trip.   Just fucking cancel that shit now.  

Whoever the fuck is in charge needs to go on national TV and just declare it - here are the new social distancing rules.....   no need to close things down but stop mixing groups without an urgent reason to, and STOP with the hand shakes.  OY!   WTF.  Stop touching your face.   Wear a mark.  Any mask is better than no mask (actually on the CDC website as an older advisory).   Jesus!

https://www.jimmunol.org/content/194/1_Supplement/148.8.short

Abstract
Age-associated changes have long been known to cause dysregulation in antiviral immune responses. The SARS epidemic of 2002-03 was characteristic in this respect that it exhibited an age-associated increase in mortality. **We recently reported that an age-related increase in an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) contributed to the observed higher mortality in SARS-CoV infected aged compared to young mice.** To examine the factors that resulted in elevated levels of PGD2 in aged mouse lungs, we analyzed the gene expression levels of several enzymes in the eicosanoid pathway. **Remarkably, secretory phospholipase A2 group 2D (Pla2g2d), which is preferentially expressed in lung CD11c+ cells, was significantly higher in aged compared to young mice.** Lipid profiling of aged and young SARS-CoV-infected mice revealed that unlike young mice, **aged mice failed to upregulate many pro-inflammatory lipid mediators** although both groups upregulated the pro-resolving ones. Further, aged mice lacking PLA2G2D expression (Pla2g2d-/-) mice exhibited enhanced virus clearance, increased lung DC migration to the draining lymph nodes and increased virus specific T cell responses. Infection of aged Pla2g2d-/- mice with SARS-CoV increased survival from 20% to 80-90%, compared to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. **Altogether our data identify a novel role for Pla2g2d in the lungs of aged mice in skewing the lipidome to an anti-inflammatory state and thus predisposing the animal to a worse outcome following SARS-CoV infection.**",t3_fedbnf,False,5Train31D,1583525917.0,2

9823,"Some studies are claiming the coronavirus attacks the upper respiratory system and the nervous system. When a dropplet of saliva or mucus enters the nose and reaches the olfatory nerves  it binds to neurons making its way towards the brainstem, especialy the area in charge of spontaneous breathing. 

This could explain why the person can be infected and not showing any signs until it reaches the brainstem.

This is the infection mechanism that might be the cause of most critical cases. Another infection mechanism is when it binds to the upper respiratory airways cells, reacting in a pattern similar to colds, and the flu.

When you are young probably the nervous system is still able to afford some dead neurons and destroys the infected, but as you get older the nervous system does not kill the infected neural cells and allows them to contaminate and propagate until it reaches the cns (central nervous system). 

At that point you have a 50% chance of losing your ability to breathe automaticaly; in other words you can only breathe consciously, so if you fall sleep or forget to exhale/inhale you wont breathe. Eventually not enough oxygen will go to the brain. Conciouness will be lost and so your breathing. You will need respiratory assistance.

Keep your nervous system healthy. Do not touch your mouth, eyes, nose and ears. Clean your god damn hands like your life depended on it, literally. Avoid congested places, improperly ventilated areas, and sick people. Block dropplets from entering the respiratory system. Block it with anything, a bandana, a scarf, a shirt, masks help too, however please leave n95 mask to doctors they need them the most. 

Keep yourself healthy, viruses like herpes, polio, influenza and rabies act in a very similar ways and some of then never leave the brain. Nobody knows if a cure will be found, and how long it could take. This S...t is getting out of hands.

**Age-related dysregulation in the lipidome compromises the immune response to the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (VIR5P.1140)**

Abstract Age-associated changes have long been known to cause dysregulation in antiviral immune responses. The SARS epidemic of 2002-03 was characteristic in this respect that it exhibited an age-associated increase in mortality. We recently reported that an age-related increase in an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) contributed to the observed higher mortality in SARS-CoV infected aged compared to young mice. To examine the factors that resulted in elevated levels of PGD2 in aged mouse lungs, we analyzed the gene expression levels of several enzymes in the eicosanoid pathway. **Remarkably, secretory phospholipase A2 group 2D (Pla2g2d), which is preferentially expressed in lung CD11c+ cells, was significantly higher in aged compared to young mice.** Lipid profiling of aged and young SARS-CoV-infected mice revealed that **unlike young mice, aged mice failed to upregulate many pro-inflammatory lipid mediators** although both groups upregulated the pro-resolving ones. Further, aged mice lacking PLA2G2D expression (Pla2g2d-/-) mice exhibited enhanced virus clearance, increased lung DC migration to the draining lymph nodes and increased virus specific T cell responses. Infection of aged Pla2g2d-/- mice with SARS-CoV increased survival from 20% to 80-90%, compared to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. **Altogether our data identify a novel role for Pla2g2d in the lungs of aged mice in skewing the lipidome to an anti-inflammatory state and thus predisposing the animal to a worse outcome following SARS-CoV infection.**",t3_fedbnf,False,5Train31D,1583525784.0,3

10008,"I can't find the exact theory this time, it was weeks ago and linked to this sub I think. But I found the following info:

"" experts theorize that whether a coronavirus infection takes a turn for the worse depends on a person’s immune response. “The virus matters, but the host response matters at least as much, and probably more,” says Stanley Perlman, a virologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa.

Once SARS-CoV-2 gets inside the human respiratory tract, it’s thought to infect and multiply in cells lining the airway, causing damage that kicks the immune system into action. In most people, it should trigger a wave of local inflammation, recruiting immune cells in the vicinity to eradicate the pathogen. The immune response then recedes, and patients recover. 

For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, some people—especially the elderly and sick—may have dysfunctional immune system response that fail to keep the response to particular pathogens in check. This could cause an uncontrolled immune response, triggering an overproduction of immune cells and their signaling molecules and leading to a cytokine storm often associated with a flood of immune cells into the lung. “That’s when you end up with a lot of these really severe inflammatory disease conditions like pneumonia, shortness of breath, inflammation of the airway, and so forth,” says Rasmussen. 

Local inflammation can turn into widespread inflammation of the lungs, which then has ripple effects across all organs of the body. This could also happen if the virus replicates faster than the immune system can respond, so that it then has to play catch-up to contain the pathogen—a situation that could also cause the immune defense to spiral out of control.""",t3_fedbnf,False,albhed,1583520965.0,1

My chest feels tight and it feels impossible to take a deep breath naturally. Occasionally I'll feel a sharp pain in my chest after breathing. 
No runny nose though. I don't really have much congestion tbh. I also don't really have flu like symptoms. I have an appetite, and my muscles don't ache (although my back hurts from laying in bed all day.)

On the 2nd day I seriously thought I was gonna die because I couldn't breathe. I went to the ER and after they did basic vital tests, said I was fine. They drew some blood and I got incredibly tired and honestly don't remember much of how I got home. 

My symptoms have since got worse, and now have a sore throat (probably from the coughing?) But I know the ER can't treat me so what's the point in going back. Im currently laying down struggling to breathe. I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm just supposed to head home for spring break and see my parents and family in a few days.

Idk what other countries do, but in my city the hospitals already started preparing for this flu weeks ago. Telling people to not go outside if they feel sick. They should call the doctor/hospital or health office instead of going there.
Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds atleast. Try not shaking hands and dont cough in your hands.

They might be confirmed later than severe cases, but in the end they still get confirmed.

The video name says, a caregiver(23 yo) is infected Corona-Panic in the Clemens-August elementary school in Bonn
In the video they just say he had symptoms of an slight cold. They tested him between friday and saturday, but never say if the test is positive or negative.

So if you are paranoid you just accept that the test is positive but they hide information to just give a headline, have some clicks on youtube and make people panic. To be honest, I never heard something new about this case about the caregiver.

10862,"This 100,000 figure is pretty meaningless.

I fear we are losing sight of the fact that there is a difference between:

(1) **Actual current cases** (unknown).

(2) Actual **current confirmed cases**, which is a known figure but never reported.

(3) **Total confirmed** **cases**, which is the number everyone is quoting but which is pretty useless in the grand scheme of things.

Now that the majority of confirmed cases in China have been declared cured, I think we should move away from reporting **total confirmed cases** and report on **current confirmed cases** instead. Of course, neither figure is likely to represent the true position, but every day that passes, the **total confirmed cases** figure becomes more and more meaningless.

To illustrate this, the John Hopkins [dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) as of now reports:

100,330 total confirmed cases,

55,694 total recoveries, and

3,408 total deaths.

This means reporting the 100,000 figure in the media gives the wrong impression that there are currently 100,000 people ""out there"" who are infected, when the reality is that the number of **current confirmed cases** is closer to 40,000 or 50,000 (assuming there is no doubling up with re-infections and the like).

I hope they stop using the total and start using a better metric to estimate the current status of the outbreak.

This article deals with the status and efforts regarding the 2009 flu pandemic by country and continent/region.



As the pandemic progressed, laboratory testing and confirmation decreased. Confirmed figures for the United Kingdom, in particular, are only meaningful up to 2 July, when routine testing stopped and presumed cases were treated without laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries stopped issuing estimates of the infected population, making this list inaccurate.

During the Cold War, the term Third World referred to the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the nations not aligned with either the First World or the Second World.The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Eastern Bloc (or Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, ""Third World"" was a political, rather than an economic, grouping. In the decade following the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the term ""Third World"" was used interchangeably with ""developing countries"", but the concept has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world.

Normal flu has an R0 of around 1.2 which means it only just spreads to more than 1 person on average, but in the summer it drops below 1 so flus peter out.

1.) Not as much rain to wash away viruses and dirt containing the viruses from sidewalks. People's shoes are also not as likely to come into contact with flowing/fresh rain water, which naturally helps to clean off shoes (a lot of germs enter your home through your shoes, so take them off!)

2.) People stay inside more often, which means more people are more likely to breath the same air and touch the same objects.

3.) Immune systems may be comprimised in winter due to less sunlight, change in diet, and less physical activity.

No evidence at this point that the US plans to try to slow this down.,t3_feh02z,False,JCGolf,1583520875.0,3

11706,"Yeah. No one gets it anymore because the spread reaches its peak. This could stop at less than 100% because as more people get it, recover...there is less probability of encountering an infected person. I’d look to Iran to see what this looks like.",t3_feh02z,False,JCGolf,1583519733.0,0
11707,"We've effectively said we're going to treat it like the flu in Canada.  Canada's approach is very similar to the US.  We are doing more testing, but still not to a level where we should.",t3_feh02z,False,justanotherreddituse,1583534550.0,2

11709,"Yes, you are correct.  Singapore currently has 130, but they did a great job or containment.  But there is a chance the warmer weather suppressed it there.  For some reason they didn't follow the Iran/South Korea/Italy trajectory, and I personally don't think it was just the reactive measures.  There was very limited community spread.",t3_feh02z,False,joemeni,1583524959.0,3
