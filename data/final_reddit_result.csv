I ended up in the hospital here in Los Angeles three days after getting back. I had pneumonia in my left lung. I asked to be screened for Coronavirus and was denied. I went back today because I’m still coughing blood. I was denied coronavirus testing again. Just pneumonia meds not that there is a med for Coronavirus. 

I don’t know why the news is reporting what it is reporting. A major hospital in Los Angeles with me as a patient that has exact Coronavirus symptoms is denied testing. Five day fever, cough, shortness of breath, blood in mucus, confirmed pneumonia, and so on. The CDC told the hospital that I can’t be tested since I haven’t travelled to Iran, Italy, or China. If you do not fit the CDC mold here in California then you can’t be tested."

I posted this yesterday and I'm posting it again because our district STILL refuses to be sane. **Please share this far and wide so that more lives are not put in danger.**

**Edit (3/6/2020):** Thank you all so much for your support and awards! I never expected this post to get this much attention. A producer from a news agency has contacted me and offered to make a story on our situation. This is exactly what we needed to put pressure on the district so that more lives are not lost.

Healthcare and EMS particularly is significantly overwhelmed and understaffed. That's nothing new and was happening even before the Coronavirus outbreak. 

With 14 day isolation precautions in regards to coronavirus, we could see serious and significant staffing problems for ambulances, hospitals, firefighters, and police. 

On the topic of EMS are limiting the use of N95 masks. Limiting them to confirmed cases or highly suspected cases, and that definition is gray. We go to multiple hospitals, nursing homes, our fire station, and public areas on a daily basis. We could come in contact with a patient exhibiting signs and symptoms, but do not meet our requirement to wear N95s. It could spread like wildfire before we ever get confirmation that they do in fact have coronavirus. Than, that ambulance crew and any fire personnel, healthcare workers, and anyone else will need to isolate for 14 days.

It is not just Coronavirus that will be killing people during this outbreak. Emergency surgeries from accidents, heart attacks, strokes, and other medical emergencies will be impacted because these cases often need a couple of days in ICU after surgery but the ICU is now full of virus patients. Elective surgeries that people have been waiting for months for are being canceled for the same reason. Organ transplants will be off the agenda so people will die waiting. Those who have been waiting for hip replacements etc will have to remain in pain and unable to move around for the foreseeable future. 

My brother-in-law is scheduled for surgery on the 28th of this month. He already has a 50% chance of losing his leg and without the surgery he has a huge chance of dying. I was due for an operation on the 27th. Without surgery my life will be limited and painful. BIL and I are in isolation at home so we don't get sick before our surgical dates.

If you have friends and family that are blasé about the risk this virus poses, ask them if they are ok with infecting others who will then be filling hospitals so that emergency patients cannot get the treatment they need to live. Are they fine with the little girl down the road being unable to have her cancer diagnosed in a timely manner and treated early to ensure she gets a chance to grow up?

1. US demands quarantines wherever community spread is present. People won't go to work if they can work at home. We can slow down the spread but our most poor will suffer. They will eventually get sick and try to keep going to work to pay rent. This will eventually overwhelm hospitals but not as bad. 

2. US lets people keep going to work. Schools don't close until kids get sick. The kids will spread it to the parents and people will end up staying at home sick around the same time. This will exacerbate the hospitals but you'll get over the spread faster. Low income still suffers unless there's a government paid time-off.

TL;DR: disinfecting works and won't compromise the mask

the original two paper are in Chinese, but I'll link them anyway:

[抛弃式防尘口罩灭菌再使用之可行性探讨](https://labor-elearning.mol.gov.tw/co_report_detail.php?rid=115)

I'll to duplicate the main result in English:

1. Oven at 70C 30 min/ UV light at 254nm 303uw/cm\^2 30sec will effectively disinfect the mask without compromise it at all
2. liquid disinfectant can effectively disinfect the mask, but will reduce the filtering efficacy much more significant than dry methods
3. BUT, among several liquid disinfectant tested, they only reduce filtering efficacy by around 1% AT MOST!! N95 masks can be effectively disinfected with alcohol and still at 94% efficacy, no longer higher than 95% but it's still very effective protection!
4. No matter how you disinfect the mast, you should replace it when it's hard to breath with it.

I'll try my best to answer questions, but please spread this information. Don't throw away masks as they are getting even harder to get."

We need to do a pandemic moonshot. Speaking for the US, but other countries should as well. Spend a trillion or so over the next 10 years advancing our technology to quickly test for viruses like this and to quickly spit out vaccines.  We should have a goal of a universal tester of some sort and a mechanism to produce mass quantities of vaccines for pretty much anything we're up against.

The government saying public transit is safe is BS, in particularly during rush hour. How is it safe when people are packed in the trains like sardines, coughing and sneezing on one another with a population that doesn't have a habit to wear face mask during flu season or a potential pandemic? People go to work sick all the time and are still doing it, because they're not taking this seriously. While they transit to work they infect other passengers who continues to go to work while sick as well. I can't imagine how far the community outbreak Vancouver has gone - probably just as bad as Seattle or worse. Our government claims they are testing and doing such a great job, but according other professionals they're not doing enough. The stringent exposure criteria requires the potential person to have been exposed to a confirmed case or travel history, otherwise no test will be provided. Mild cases will go undetected and walk around out in the public and infect more people. **This exposure criteria has not been updated since confirming the community transmission case.**"

I've been following along to this subreddit, trying to get facts and not succumb to hysteria. With the news wanting big stories, that's hard to do.

So just today at work, I was in a LARGE hospital (largest hospital in several states, with a cancer center, full heart institute, full pediatric center, you get the idea) for a meeting.

We walked through many parts of the hospital, from the main entrance, staff/admin areas, through patient areas and even through the basement and mechanical/electrical service areas.

One guy made a joke about ""corona and lime"" like no one has heard that joke before. \*eye roll\*

&#x200B;

\*\*We were all in a big circle, talking, and this other guy, who is a fairly high level project manager, pulls out a tissue and blows his nose right in front of us. He digs it into his nostrils and pushes it around (to get all the mucous???) It was LOUD and disgusting. He puts the tissue back into his pocket, then with his RIGHT hand, rubs his nose a few times and sniffs loudly.\*\*

&#x200B;

He shook a few hands after that, and was walking around, opening doors, touching elevator buttons, using his phone.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, since I've interfaced with the healthcare industry a long time (but not a doctor or nurse) I'm in the habit of 'foam in/foam out' like entering and leaving a patient room. Basically, at the hospital, every time I pass a Purell foam station, you bet I get two squirts of foam and rub my hands together.

&#x200B;

One person in our group looked at me and tried making a joke about me being paranoid about getting sick. I just said ""meh, I spend time in hospitals, so it's a habit."" Meanwhile, I'm thinking: ""Some dude in our group just blew his nose and rubbed his snot on his hand, and has been touching surfaces, AND you shook his hand! And there are sick people all around us, some with masks, in this enormous hospital that takes up many city blocks. And you think I'm silly for using hand sanitizer?""

&#x200B;

If people could just wash their hands, cover when they cough and sneeze, and use sanitizer like they should, not only would coronavirus die out, but there wouldn't be such a big problem with the flu, colds and other such illness.

&#x200B;

... Just wanted to vent. I was disgusted at the guy who blew his nose like that, in front of all of us, in a HOSPITAL, with sick people around..."

Here are the mitigation efforts we are performing and a plan we've strategized in the event that one of us gets sick and infected with coronavirus (*and cannot seek medical help for some reason*).

Feel free to leave any feedback or improvements to the plan, also feel free to adapt/use this as a potential framework.

# Mitigation Efforts

* When arriving home, all roommates **MUST** use hand sanitizer at the door **BEFORE** touching any other surfaces  

   * One may also use the sink located in the laundry room, *assuming the infected roommate plan is not in place*
* Shoes must be taken off at the door and carried to your bedroom
* All roommates should participate in sanitizing high touch surfaces with lysol wipes including light switches, door knobs, handles, faucets, toilet, shower, and other areas
* All dishes must be placed in the dishwasher  

   * Dishes may be placed in the sink if the dishwasher is running
* All large gatherings must seek roommate approval to host
* **If you display any symptoms (fever, coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat) all roommates must be notified immediately regardless of severity**  

   * **Depending on severity of symptoms, the other roommates will have the final call on enacting the infected roommate plan or requesting the potentially infected roommate to seek medical help**
   * **See infected roommate plan for mitigation efforts**

# Infected Roommate Plan ☣︎

In the event one of us becomes infected or shows strong symptoms of the virus, here are the proposed mitigation efforts.

* If light symptoms (cough/fever/sore throat), they should isolate in their bedroom and follow the below mitigation measures.
* If strong symptoms (persistent fever/cough/sore throat/trouble breathing) the person should seek medical care at a hospital. The following mitigation measures apply.
* Self quarantine in their bedroom until the fever and cough has subsided for 48 hours without use of flu medication/cough suppressant/fever reducers
* When leaving their bedroom a non ventilated N-95 or surgical mask must be worn at all times by the infected person.  

   * Close all windows in the quarantine room before leaving, to ensure the draft does not carry the virus through the house (in the event of the front door opening)
* **Before** entering the bathroom or kitchen, they must use the sink located in the laundry room to wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.
* A trash bag must be kept in their own bedroom. All tissues, food scraps, trash, etc. must be disposed of in their own garbage bag, NOT in the communal garbage locations, including the bathroom.  

   * When the garbage bag is full, they must notify the other roommates to dispose of it properly.  

      * The garbage bag must be taken directly from their bedroom/door **DIRECTLY** to the curb (*regardless of day of week*). Gloves are required for touching trash and the person must clean their hands after.
* After using the bathroom they must sanitize (lysol wipe) any touched surface including sink faucets, light switches, shower doors, or other surfaces.  

   * If they are unable to perform this task, they must notify the other roommates that they have used the restroom and did not sanitize surfaces
* Towels for the restroom must be kept in their own bedroom and placed in a specific location within the bathroom (designated towel rack) to be sanitized after.
* If using the shower, after use they must notify other roommates that they have used the shower so it can be properly sanitized
* If using the laundry machine, after use they must sanitize the laundry machine with an empty load and ½ cup of bleach or notify roommates to perform this task
* All dishes MUST be placed in the dishwasher  

   * If the dishwasher is running, they must leave dishes in their room until they can be safely placed in the dishwasher.
* Roommate(s) will be tasked with leaving food/water/supplies in front of their door, grocery shopping, and ensuring their comfort during their quarantine/illness
* All high touch surfaces must be cleaned consistently by the other roommates
* Constant communication with the infected person to ensure their health & wellbeing via digital chat or checking by knocking on their door
* Contact information of the infected persons parents/contacts should be shared
* Insurance information should be made available so roommates will have knowledge in the event medical assistance is required"

Updated death rates by country using the # deaths / # cases method. Sourced data from worldometers.

Closed cases = deaths + recoveries. Keep in mind, recoveries have not been well reported in most countries.

DISCLAMER: lack of testing typically makes these death rates higher, because you aren't catching the mild cases. US also got hit in the worst possible place: nursing home. Their rate \*should\* fall as more people are tested

OVERALL is 3.4% (3462 deaths / 101878 cases). With 5.8% of closed cases ending in death

USA is 5.2% (14 deaths / 270 cases). With 48.3% of closed cases ending in death

Korean government didn't just acted emotionally based on past history(although I have to admit it does play a big part.)

1. Japan didn't place bans on ""People coming from Korea"". They banned ""Koreans, regardless of whether they coming from USA, France or other countries""

2. Japan nullified all Visas. Including Korean people who are already in Japan even before the outbreak started.

3. Japanese government never consulted or even inform the Korean government beforehand. They just announced it right on.

4. Japan's quarantine is unlawful even by Japanese law. The Japanese ministry of health admitted the have 'no legal basis' on placing these bans.

Of course, you can still argue retaliation is a dangerous and unwise move(which I agree), but I wanted to make some basic facts simple."

This number would give a sense of how widespread the disease is, and how forceful a response to it the United States is mustering. But for days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has refused to publish such a count, despite public anxiety and criticism from Congress. On Monday, Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, estimated that “by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed” in the United States. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence promised that “roughly 1.5 million tests” would be available this week. 

But the number of tests performed across the country has fallen far short of those projections, despite extraordinarily high demand, The Atlantic has found.

Then focus moves to reporting celebrities, politicians, and other familiar names. Then interest wanes. It becomes normalized like passing from cancer. 

Treatment options get better. Still, 5 to 15 percent of over 70 crowd succumb, there’s a blip of other deaths due to hospital overcrowding, and overall life expectancy goes down. Then a vaccine levels off the number of new cases. We reach a new stasis, with fewer aged people with underlying health conditions (the cohort that consumes the largest percentage of health care services). Better pandemic preparedness. A healthier respect for viruses. 

So there’s a silver lining. But the two year cost in dollars, lives, and misery is huge. There’s no point to this post. Just trying to think it through. What am I missing?"

Instead of just picking the shape of the outcome probability curve, I realized that what I am  really trying to model is a Cumulative Density Function which is the integral of a normal distribution representing the behavior of a random (gaussian) event.  I also add the normal distribution fit for time it takes from diagnosed to recovered.

**Hypothesis:**  
The 2.3% and later 3.4% numbers seem to be the ratio of deaths/confirmed cases. However deaths tend to occur after diagnosis, so the true death counts will lag confirmed cases by days to weeks. This would imply that the ratio of current deaths to current confirmed cases, under-represents the actual CFR, once you allow for the recently diagnosed to resolve. 

**Plots:** [https://imgur.com/a/gVh0uml](https://imgur.com/a/gVh0uml)

**Steps:**

* Represent the death and recovered event probability vs days-after-diagnosis as a normal distribution
* Integrate the normal distributions to get a Cumulative Density Function, which now represents the probability of being dead or recovered as a function of days-after-diagnosis
* Apply the CDF separately to each population of confirmed cases per-day
* Sum the outcomes of each daily population to get the total death/recovered outcomes per-day
* Use least squares to estimate the sigma and mean of the normal distribution, such that the daily predicted totals match the actual totals

**Data:**

* John's Hopkins dataset: [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases - Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)

**Code:**

* [https://gist.github.com/ctung/b31726c64e55b7ce48887f98b52c6acf](https://gist.github.com/ctung/b31726c64e55b7ce48887f98b52c6acf)

**Caveats:**

* This model does not factor in age, location, pre-existing co-morbidities, etc, so it will not be useful for predicting individual outcomes
* Changes in the length of time to complete a diagnosis will skew the end results.
* This models deaths vs confirmed cases (CFR). This does not attempt to model deaths vs infections (IFR).
* Outcomes may not be normal (eg the CFR in Wuhan is most likely very different than the CFR in other provinces or countries)  Here I am lumping all cases together as a global count because data outside of China is too sparse to model at this time.

**Conclusions from the model** (which may or may not be true)

* The CFR has to be around 4% to accurately explain the death count profile.
* The mean date for death is 7 days after diagnosis ( I have read the actual is 14?)
* Some small percentage of the confirmed cases are determined post-mortem?
* recovery takes on average 21 days after diagnosis

**Next Steps:**

* Incorporate age into the model
* Experiment with estimates of untested infection counts to estimate IFR (Like the recently publish Harvard paper)
* Try to find datasets that can validate some of the conclusions from the model

Does anyone know of a way to get tested specifically in hessen, germany near frankfurt?

is there much of a risk at all or is it just being misreported by the media?

would it help to ""ban"" my dad to another floor since we live in a house with multiple floors or would being diligent about washing hands and not touching be ""enough""?

This necessitates extreme restrictions on personal movements in order to slow the spread of the disease.  When such measures are taken, the economy is affected by lack of purchases and lack of wages.  The true cost of the virus, then, is only the equivalent of doubling normal flu deaths, and the economic losses caused by quarantine.  Knowing this, local leaders are unlikely to undertake the aforementioned quarantine measures.  There's no specific treatment for the coronavirus, and a quarantine would affect a great many more people, possibly making a huge number homeless.

> 75 to 80 percent of all clusters are in families. You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or prisons, but the vast majority are in families. And only 5 to 15 percent of your close contacts develop disease. So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible, and find everyone you had contact with in 48 hours before that

> “Mild” was a positive test, fever, cough — maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen. “Severe” was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. “Critical” was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.

> Q: So saying 80 percent of all cases are mild doesn’t mean what we thought.

> This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses — people didn’t think it was big enough or fast enough to have the impact it does.

> China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some I see here in Switzerland. We’d ask, “How many ventilators do you have?” They’d say “50.” Wow! We’d say, “How many ECMOs?” They’d say “five.” The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, “Five? In Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin.”"

I'm not sure how to upload a picture... I have a picture of this, a data for February 18th, but it is intuitive so I use it

[https://upload.cc/i1/2020/03/07/cV2TQX.png](https://upload.cc/i1/2020/03/07/cV2TQX.png)

age 0 30 40 50 60 70

the upper graph: confirmed cases:10.3% 17% 19.2% 22.4% 19.2% 11.9%

the lower graph:death cases:0.8% 1.8% 3.7% 12.7% 30.2% 50.8%

and the text under the graph: Only half of the patients over 50 years old in confirmed cases, but in the death case, 93.7% of patients over 50 years old. it means all age could be infected, But older people are more likely to die.

so older people are more dangerous, it's true, but we also heard some young people die. a doctor called Li Wenliang (you can search the name) 35 years old, who warned about this plague, He was diagnosed on February 1, he posted the message about his condition on Weibo (a web like twitter), then his situation became very terrible on February 6. The doctor spared no effort to rescue him, even used ECMO. but unfortunately, it's too late. he died so fast.

I hope the doctors of other countries can treat the elderly effectively. if you are young people, don't too worry, stay optimistic, but be alert. the patient may be worsened,  they need a ventilator to support their breath. So you can't think ""I can walk or run, that's ok, no problem"". Don't take it lightly, if the bad thing happens, you feel hard to breathe, please wear PPE to avoid cross-infection, and go to the hospital, don't take oxygen at home by yourself.  We paid so many lives to learn this lesson.

may god bless you."

#Many retail pharmacies are already understaffed. With COVID-19, it is eventually going to be even harder to find employees to keep pharmacies open and serving the public.

Chain owners and their district managers need to:

1) Temporarily employ a larger number of floating pharmacists and techs so that pharmacies will have the available man-power to stay open.

1.5) On this same note and as we all know, many pharmacists feel pressure to work while being sick because it's too hard to find a replacement on short notice.

This needs to be changed immediately.

Pharmacists need to be able to call in sick that morning to say they won't be coming in if they are suddenly feeling ill in order to prevent spreading the virus and to protect their own health.

For the past decade or longer, this has not been the case.

2) Install physical germ-barrier shields in pharmacies so that patients can't cough and sneeze on staff.

3) Provide masks and other protective medical gear for staff.

3.5) On that same note, if they could provide masks and hand sanitizer to patients who appear to be sick while waiting in line, that would be ideal.

4) Chains need to make sure that pharmacy staff have plenty of paid sick leave so that employees can afford to stay home and not work sick and/or in case they become quarantined to their homes for 2 weeks.

Thanks!"

After polling the volunteers, I found that 85% were sick. Many were sick after coming from out of the country and being on vacation. No one was told to self quarantine (even those coming back from Italy.) I have called Mass Health Dept., CDC, my doctors office and local town officials. 

I am sick with flu like symptoms and was told that I sound like I have symtoms of the virus and that I should self quarantine. I mentioned that I've come in contact with hundreds of people when I was mildly symptomatic being that I work with the public and should I be tested? They said they are only testing those that are coming from Italy with flu like symptoms and that is it, even though they know community spread at this point is likely.

I was a sailor in the RN and a thing we were ALWAYS hounded on was washing hands and body in HOT water. It is not enough to say wash your hands. I often claim never to drink water because ""fish piss in it"" and while that is a bit facetious, it gives me the right to drink hot drinks or booze. Note that at 4c coronaviruses still thrive in water. At 23c they 'inactivate' I presume hotter too. People on cruise ships, airplanes etc often drink water they are served, or take from a tap. Others believe that just washing hands will kill viruses of this kind. I have not seen a single post on this page that comments about water. (Nor the link to cruise ships etc.)  OK I won't rabbit on. The paper is hard enough to read, BUT I think most important if one is not to keep on passing this little thing around. BTW A report by Dr Norman Swan on the AUS ABC Health Report states that at Wuhan there were 44 samples taken and the ONLY sample that showed the virus was in a fish tank. NOT anywhere else.

We returned to Maryland after a funeral in Seattle last weekend and he now has a fever and a cough as of Wednesday. Yesterday, I got redirected to the state department of health and they were not testing anyone other than people who had traveled to Iran or China or people who had come in direct contact with a known case. 

But I read yesterday that the CDC had relaxed their guidelines to let people with doctor's orders to get tested. Cut to me finding out that we can't get a doctors order because he didn't see a PCP since his insurance switched in January and urgent care told me that only a PCP can write the order (?). Of course, no PCP wants him to come into the office for a new patient visit due to his symptoms. I called the same number for the state department of health today and, probably because we now have 3 confirmed cases in Maryland, she cut me off and told me to call 211 (which was useless).

I'm practically banging my head against my desk now. We might be able to go to the emergency room to get testing approved but his symptoms aren't that bad and we don't want to put the elderly or people with underlying issues at risk.

We've been selfisolating since Wednesday. Fortunately, his work is being cooperative but he has a public facing role in government and as of right now the recommendation is that he's okay to come back to work 24 hours after his symptoms reside instead of 14 days of selfisolation. They also want an okay to return to work note from a PCP which will require him to go to a PCP office while possibly still contagious (!!). As for me, I'm starting a new job on Monday and don't want to bring the virus with me if that's what he has.

Hearing about how easy it is to get tested in comparison in South Korea makes me want to slam my head through the wall."

Just the simple math to get a sense and to use this in relation to quarantines and the financial markets.

Great news! Do you think this is because of the great healthcare system and/or treatment? 

OR will it just all come down delayed on Germany? OR could there be a flaw in the reporting system? (eg ""died of pneumonia"" instead of ""died of complications from COVID-19"")

Other EU countries close by like France and Italy are roughly within the WHO mortality statistic.

If this is indeed the big one that the WHO are talking about, how big is it going to be? Spanish Flu x 100? Global genocide? I can see a fuckload of more deaths in the forthcoming months as the spread continues, a lot of people are gonna die and get other people killed and that's what worries me

Friendly degenerate here.

Quick suggestion, what do you guys think about leaving the BNO posts up regardless if there’s a post before hand.

Due to the increase in news lately, BNO tends to be a few minutes behind now, which has caused posts with their tweets to get removed due to it technically being a repost.

Only reason would be because the BNO posts are easily identifiable and known to be reliable. It’s much easier to see, rather than sifting through inconsistent titles and wild phrasing from a huge variety of sources."

Dear Prime Minister, dear fellow citizens,

Belgium has experienced many political crises, it is a local specialty for which we are famous in the world, but it ***is facing today its first real crisis since the Second World War***, and it turns out to be very badly prepared to respond to it effectively.

The attitude of the Ministry of Public Health is paternalistic, with the message: we are prepared, we have a pandemic plan, we have groups of experts, we are monitoring the situation closely, we are controlling the situation, we are communicating as it is necessary, and we are not interested in independent criticism of health professionals or scientists.

However, apart from the disinterest in the opinion of professionals independent of the government, nothing could be further from the truth: we are not prepared, we do not have a pandemic plan, government experts demonstrate a lack of knowledge of this new coronavirus characteristics, they follow the situation closely but refuse to anticipate it, and communication remains incoherent, for the simple reason that they do not sufficiently understand the nature of the danger we face.

**Belgium does not have a pandemic plan.**

This information will probably even surprise the Minister of Health, but Belgium does not in fact have a pandemic plan! Instead of having one, Belgium has an epidemic plan and there is a crucial difference between the two.

Contrary to epidemics where the foci of infections remain localized in certain regions of the globe, as was the case for both SARS and MERS, in a pandemic these foci continue to spread uncontrollably in most countries.

The consequence of this difference is a logistical problem; the supply chains of materials necessary for health care are interrupted. For this reason, ***a true pandemic plan is based on the concept of strategic reserve:***all the material necessary not only to ensure the normal functioning of our health care system, but also to have the capacity to absorb the inevitable increase in the number of patients to be treated must be kept in stock in sufficient quantity if it is not produced on Belgian territory.

We are already in shortage of masks, so Belgium does not have a pandemic plan. Contrary to the assertions of the Minister of Health, we are therefore not prepared and it is urgent that the government takes all the measures necessary to remedy this deficiency.

**Confronting the reality of the situation.**

Those who do not have the professional skills to judge the situation for themselves are reduced to trying to determine which expert is closest to the reality of the situation, an exercise in futility.

I believe, on the contrary, that it is possible to explain the reality of the situation in an intelligible way to the government and to the general public, but that requires everyone to make a little effort to understand the two most important figures in epidemiology from a public health perspective. Once this information is understood, ***everyone will be in a position to assess the proportionality of the public health measures***that have been taken and that remain to be taken.

**What are the conditions that favor the emergence of a pandemic?**

A new contagious virus for which the population has no immunity. The more contagious the virus, the greater the difficulty in containing it, the greater the risk of a pandemic. The flow of people and goods in the modern world, as well as the concentration of the population in urban areas increase the pandemic potential of emerging viruses.

**Public health measures to counter the spread of the virus.**

The spread of a virus is closely linked to the frequency of contact between individuals, the more contact there is, the more the probability of transmission increases. And so the essence of public health measures for a pandemic virus is to ***reduce the frequency of contact between individuals as much as possible,***it is no secret.

**Can we contain the spread of a virus with pandemic potential?**

Yes, if the required public health measures are implemented without delay. Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, countries that have much closer contacts with China, have been able to stem the spread of the virus in their country. They were exposed to the SARS epidemic in 2003 and their public health officials learned the right lessons. They were ready, and that ***proves that it is possible to have an effective response to a pandemic***.

**Containing a pandemic virus is a race against time.**

On the starting line, we have a new virus and public health systems around the world. The virus starts first, but slowly, and it is up to health systems to respond without delay, as the virus spreads faster by the day. The virus respects neither borders nor schedules, and it does not take a break during the carnival holidays. The Minister of Health assures us that we are 5-6 weeks behind Italy. We are 22 days behind Italy. ***Every day counts.***

**Usual dangers and unusual dangers.**

People are generally well prepared for the dangers they face regularly, because these dangers correspond to their usual experience. ***No one is psychologically prepared for a pandemic,***the last one took place a little over 100 years ago and therefore no one has personal experience of a pandemic: it is very difficult for people to anticipate the explosive nature of the spread of an infectious agent, even though it is well established scientifically that a virus spreads exponentially.

**Exponential multiplication**

Apart from financiers, engineers and scientists, the properties of the exponential function remain very abstract for members of government and the general public, and I will try to make them more concrete. We are all very familiar with the functions of addition and multiplication because we use them daily. The exponential function is a series of multiplication, and our intuition is less developed on the implications of a series multiplication, because there are few phenomena around us that flagrantly follow this function.

To make it clear what is going on in a pandemic, I would like to make the connection with two exponential phenomena with which most people are familiar.

**The compound interest loan and the stick of dynamite**

A stick of dynamite and compound interest are two exponential phenomena with which we are familiar. What happens when dynamite explodes?

One molecule of TNT reacts and makes 1000 other molecules react a fraction of a second later, and that is 1000 molecules in turn make each 1000 other molecules react the same fraction of a second later, and this million molecules which react, produce a billion, then a trillion etc., every fraction of a second until all the TNT has reacted in less than a second. Result? BOOM, the stick exploded.

At the other end of the speed spectrum, you can take compound interest. Consider buying a loan-funded home with an annual interest rate of 2.5%. You may think, 2.5% is not much, but if you do the math, on a 30-year contract you end up paying as much in interest as the price of the house. And that's the power of the exponential function, it goes up quickly, with an annual rate of 5%, we pay more than 3 times the price of the house in interest! The predatory and amoral character of our financial system is a debate for another day, but is an important factor in the systemic precariousness of modern society, which can only be exposed by the developing crisis.

A pandemic is halfway between a compound interest loan and a stick of dynamite. ***The three phenomena are explosive,***but at different time scales, of the order of the week, year and millisecond.

I work in a hospital (Ont, Canada) in protection services (security) and there’s been an issue puzzling me for some time. I’ve been following the outbreak since the end of January and Canada now has 48 cases. 

My team is 13-14 guys and we require a minimum of 2-3 per shift, 24/7.

I was also here during the Swine Flu epidemic in 2009, right after I finished college. And I was a part-time swine flu screener then. This seems to be worse in terms of severity.

Yesterday I’ve begun compiling a resources based on China’s handling — and I’ve noted that most of their healthcare workers are always in hazmat suits and their infection rates are reportedly decreasing on the great spectrum of this thing.

The reason I bring that forth is not only for my own safety, but also because if I have to endure a 14 day self-quarantine — or worse — I get sick and am out for weeks longer, I’m unsure we’d have the sustained resources to keep our team up to par. And I can imagine we will only get busier when more people start getting sick.

If I get sick or exposed, my partner(s) will also need to be quarantined. It would be dangerous to have our entire team get sick because we’re not in proper PPE when dealing with patients and patrons and our team would ultimately all possibly end up out.

I want to convince my boss (who is in charge of pandemic planning) to permit guards to wear full hazmat suits and N95s so as to prevent getting sick as well as asymptomatically spreading it. So we suit up before shifts; get disinfected throughout and then at the end before removing the PPE. Does this seem like a reasonable measure?

It appears to me that both China and South Korea are both doing this. 

The same goes for other staff; nurses, EVS (cleaners), food services, logistical staff, etc. Unlike China, I don’t see my country taking these risks serious enough.

Again,‘it’s not the ailment that concerns me more than it’s running out of manpower if we have to quarantine and it seems wearing 24/7 PPE while here would help mitigate that."

If you will recall, I emailed you a week ago, because I was concerned there would not be sufficient planning in place for once coronavirus was upon us in Tulsa.  As you are now I'm sure aware, it is here.  It has in fact been here since 2/23, four days before my last email.

I find TPS's most recent email entirely inadequate as a response.  I am aware that there has been no federal or state decree for your organization to take action, but I plea to you, as a fellow human being, to consider you humanity and act for the good of our entire community.

Perhaps you are unaware of the risk coronavirus brings.  It is 20 times more lethal than the seasonal flu for people in my demographic, and 60 times more deadly for those in my parents' age bracket.  Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine available.  Left unchecked, it has a doubling time of roughly three days on average.  Being as it's been in Tulsa for 12 days, the math for projected number of infected works out like this:  1(initial infected) \* 1.26 \^ 12days = 16.  That's 15 Tulsans that are currently carrying coronavirus if the spread has followed the global trend.  As a state, we have conducted a total of **6 tests**.  We are considerably far behind the curve on this, and will likely not catch up.  By next Friday, the trend projects there will be 80 Tulsans with the virus.  What are the odds any of those people have contact with school age children?

This virus is the most dangerous since the spanish flu and has the potential to kill tens of millions worldwide over the next year.  The impact will be determined largely by how swiftly local communities react to halt the spread.  Children have been shown to have mild reactions to the virus and recover quickly, so their individual risk is low, however, they are also perfect vectors for the disease, typically showing little in the way of symptoms even while infectious.  Elderly and those with pre-existing conditions are not so lucky.  They will be in intense competition for medical care, and overwhelming the medical system will drastically increase the fatality rate.  The most important thing we as a community can do, is to reduce the pace of propagation.

I'm aware you're under intense pressure to maintain attendance, but please listen when I implore you to consider your humanity.  This is a once in a lifetime disease with the potential for mass devastation if not handled with the utmost respect.  You will not receive guidance from the state or CDC on this - not until it is far too late. It is therefore up to you, as an organization, to use common sense to protect your community.  TPS has the opportunity to make the single most impact in slowing this disease in Tulsa.  Doing so now can save thousands of lives.  Now is the time to act.  Now is the time to pull out all the stops if we are to have any say in the result of this pandemic on our community.  Please reconsider your most recent guidance. To do nothing is to condemn the city to endemic disease.  Please start planning immediately for remote learning and closure of schools as this is likely our only hope to avert crisis.  We need a plan for those in place now, and we need to act on it the very moment we see community spread in our City.  We have a tremendously valuable opportunity before us today - please act before it abandons us.

I say all of this as someone who has the utmost respect for education, for all that you do, and for our children and seniors.

Thank you,

\[HumanityFirstTulsan\]"

Any theories? Are they having false positives and so the total case number is too high? I can't imagine there's another few hundred deaths we somehow don't know about.

Are the other countries all underreporting and COVID-19 is only as deadly as the flu but much more infectious...? But then why did so many people from the Diamond Princess die (6 out of 696)? That's 1%. Pretty high for a flu. But also what the hell kind of a flu infects 696 people on a ship, so maybe the r0 is just insanely high. 

Are they treating patients differently in South Korea somehow?

Hi Google! You are collecting a lot of data about us all the time, especially our geolocation. You have got a lot of fire about it, but right now it can be helpful and life-saving.   

 When a new coronavirus patient is found, the Israeli ministry of health publishes an approximate path, when and where this unlucky guy was, then it asks to check if anyone was around this guy at the same location/time. I guess that in other counties something similar happens. The whole process is cumbersome and error-prone, but you can help here. You can make an app where everyone will be able to check whether he was or wasn't in that place and need to go to quarantine. You even can take in one step further and check all the people around, and if there's a match, send them a notification.  

Unfortunately, there isn't API to this data. So, no one except you can make it happens."

I'm currently living just outside a major EU city with a recent small but steady uptick in cases. I got a call last night that my grandfather (in the US) passed away (not virus-related at all - long-standing heart issues). It seems unavoidable that I'll have to travel internationally very soon for the funeral.

Aside from my own grief and being there for my family, I can't help but worry about COVID-19. Not only do I not want to catch it, but I don't want to potentially spread it to others, either.

Some practical questions that I'd love to throw out for discussion:

* What's the safest way to travel? I've been toying with two options, but I can't decide which is safer:
   * Fly from MyCity to the closest city to my parents in the US (nonstop flights available, but they're quite long)
   * Book a private sleeper cabin with a private bathroom on an overnight train from MyCity to a different major EU city that has shorter nonstop flights to the destination city. Avoid leaving the cabin the entire time; bring my own food onboard. Would involve transiting from the train station to the airport.
* How to stay as safe/healthy as possible for the funeral services? I expect friends and relatives will be coming in from other US cities, and I assume there's going to be a lot of hugging and kissing, hand-shaking, etc. There will be a lot of older folks present, and I wouldn't want to pass anything to them. :(
* On that note, here comes the eternal debate: mask or no mask for me?

Thanks, all. I hate that I even have to think about this, but I think it would be irresponsible of me not to."

how will the number of americans with an underlying condition affect the mortality and/or recovery rate?

The US has an incredible amount of people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, etc, that seem to make recovering from covid-19 much more difficult.

will the US see a higher rate of severe complications in treatment or even a higher death rate?

Although it’s curable, you may not discover yourself get infected with this disease since it’s incubation period can have 2-14 days, along with normal symptoms like cough and fever. 

If I were you, I would only take China’s infection number as reference as the actual cases must be more than that. Frankly, by doing some online research, you may discovered that the first outbreak of the coronavirus is more likely between October and November 2019. In between this two months, there are some weird increase of keyword searching such as shortness of breath, coronavirus and SARS in China’s social media. There are also reports about a couple of people who spread the news of coronavirus were being arrested in October due to spreading out false comment on the internet in china, news weren’t posted that long since the Chinese government deleted it. The another interesting part to think about is the Hong Kong postal service has stopped their delivery service in November, and specifically stated Wuhan. After all, you may wonder when does the outbreak happen actually, and how long does the government know about it.

Coronavirus is already an unavoidable disease in United States, but what matters is how will we deal with it. Just remember your hands will always get dirty after you touch something outside your home, so never touch your face with your hands before you clean your hands by washing it, using alcoholic wipes or hand sanitizer. 

Furthermore, it is also crucial to wear a face mask. However, be aware to buy the effective one, since not all mask are able to avoid the virus. In America, purchasing mask with the standards ASTM is definitely trustworthy, or BFE/VFE/PFE>97%. Dust mask is never effective!!! If you can’t purchase mask (as I have known face mask has already been in shortage since January), you can design by your own, as long as it can prevent others droplets from touching your face.

It is also essential for knowing how to wear a mask. Remember the coloured side always face away from your face and the white side always touches your face. Whenever you put on or take off your mask, try to touch the ear loop only, and never touch the coloured side since it’s full of bacteria.

God bless America."

I’ve had a sore throat since last weekend and on Tuesday I started feeling sick in the afternoon, very heavy and fatigued. I was deliriously tired on Wednesday and Thursday so stayed home but had no fever or respiratory symptoms. I’m about 50% better today and went into work because I was unsure if I was actually sick or if my fatigue was mental health related (I struggle with depression). My partner experienced similar symptoms but got better even faster than me. 

It was just announced that someone has been diagnosed with Coronavirus in my city who takes the same route on public transit that I use to get to work, at basically the same time, every morning. We could have been on the same train on Monday and Tuesday. 

What should I do? I don’t have the classic symptoms or incubation period but can’t help be worried.

Edit: Just to clarify that I am not looking for medical advice, except to the extent of whether I should try to be tested to identify if I am an exposure risk to my community, or if that’s an overreaction."

I'm going back to work tonight, so if he passed it on to me, they can probably write off our county. I don't understand why they can't just test people to be safe. Why are we treating this like it's only in a few countries?  Almost all countries have outbreaks now."

Our school district is at the [EPICENTER](https://qz.com/1810763/the-first-covid-19-death-in-the-us-has-been-reported-near-seattle/) of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States - Kirkland, Washington. 3 of our high schools serve the Kirkland area - Juanita, Tesla STEM, and Lake Washington. What has the district done in response to the immediate danger and threat to student and family safety? [Nothing](https://www.lwsd.org/programs-and-services/health-services/coronavirus-information)! Their decision today (March 5, 2020), and previously has been to keep all school activities OPEN. This includes before/after school clubs, rehearsals, athletic activities, and the 6 hours of instruction in between. They are basing this on advice from the CDC and WSDOH, which don't have the resources or boots on the ground to predict the virus's spread prior to symptoms and diagnosis.

This shows a worrying level of incompetence and lack of preparation. Thousands of students trust LWSD with their safety on a daily basis. If there is a failure in leadership now, the virus will affect district students, potentially allowing it to be carried to more vulnerable family members and leading to tragic, preventable cases. As if to tip the hat at the situation, however, the district IS allowing families to call in excused absences if they feel an ""abundance of caution"".

This is not enough. One of my peers said it best, ""you evacuate the school before a disaster, not afterwards."" The virus has an incubation period of 5 - 14 days, leading to invisible spread and consequences rendered long before any symptoms appear. Please spread awareness and [sign the petition](http://chng.it/hgsT6n9p) to convince the school district to put student safety over financial and administrative incentives. If they fumble this one, the results won't be pretty and the district will lose the public's trust."

I have told them they need to be prepared to cancel their trip and to contact companies bank etc to try and get refunds.  Our epidemic is only starting, and our government is not doing shit to help it. I’d be happy to message you to keep you updated on life and how coronavirus plays out dans le sud so you have first hand knowledge for your parents. The last thing I want is for anyone’s family to still travel during an epidemic without accurate info or knowledge of what is really going on."

All of March and April is a long timeline to see what will happen. Look how quickly things escalated in China. Although I hear the virus might lessen its hold during the spring and summer but I haven’t read concrete evidence of this.

The CDC site says that it spreads primarily via person-to-person close contact — droplets in the air produced mostly by coughing or sneezing within 6 feet of you that then make their way into your lungs. They mention that it’s possible that it can spread via surfaces, but that it’s not common or the primary way that it spreads.

You’re probably well trained in the use of PPE and sterilizing the theater equipment, so you should already be using precautions meant to protect you from a variety of diseases.

There seem to be shortages of masks, so they’re best reserved for medical workers who must be in close contact with those who are sick. If you’re not spending time close to those who are infections and use food hand hygiene, it seems like you may not be especially likely to get this. And, if you do, most people seem to be alright."

The only reason Ebola didn’t wipe us out was because it killed people too fast for them to spread the disease very far.

The worst part is the people living with that family member probably don’t take it seriously and they don’t really wash their hands or clean themselves as often as they should. 

Unfortunately, it is understandable that the number of test kits are still limited, and the sick are always priority for testing. However, we need to take it more seriously because this is something new that even the CDC doesn’t know all about yet, and it’s all about being safe then sorry."

China didn't shut down a city the size of NY just because they were afraid of accidentally killing 2 percent of the world's population.  They did it because they knew the virus would be bad enough to not only kill 2 percent but put 16-20 percent in the hospital and make 80 percent of the world mildly sick roughly around the same time.  

Those numbers don't seem bad and the illness itself compared to others isn't crazy bad for most people, which is why they're not freaking out.  But if they consider these numbers and the rate at which it will affect us they will see how much havoc this will be on healthcare systems, economic activity, and by extension political and social systems.

When people can't go to the hospital because they have a blood clot or a broken leg, when people can't get certain meds, when prices for goods increases, wages stagnant, and companies let people go, that's when the reality will sink in for them.

Getting the coronavirus isn't scary for most people.  But the consequences of almost everyone getting it at the same time, compounded by the 20 percent who will be in the hospitals if they're lucky.  That will royally fuck us up and that should keep everyone up at night because last I checked we have an already Shakey economy and an inadequate government that's utterly divided and on the verge of breaking each other's necks.  And with all these new political ideological positions and the emerging new technology thats radically transforming our lives.  This could be the eve of a massive Revolution.  Hopefully not a bloody one but we literally can't keep doing what we're doing and run our system the way  we're running it now.  

We need a networked global society that's gonna listen to scientists, not a bunch of nation's run by populist dictators.  This is a collosal failure on behalf of all of us because we've forgotten how to dream and realize a world that we want to live in, not a world that we must accept and right now we're accepting our deaths."

I am young and healthy. But I do not want to get sick, from anything, ever. Yes it's going to happen but of course I'm going to do whatever I can to avoid it. 

These are all things people should be doing every day, not just now. I watched a woman on the bus today wipe her nose on her hand and then grab the railing. A man came on the bus right after her, touched the railing, and then immediately started playing on his phone. Gross!

I have always wiped my phone down every day. I go to the gym 6 days a week and I often use my phone as a timer during exercises. This is basic hygiene stuff and people are really accusing people of over reacting for taking general care for their own health and well being."

My first thought when I started to read was it’s pretty pointless to sanitize your hands upon immediately entering your apartment if the next thing you are going to do is take off your dirty shoes and carry them through the apartment.  You all would be better off designating a communal spot for outdoor shoes and leaving them by the door, only to have to touch them when leaving the house.  If you can’t do that and you want to mitigate potential virus spread, at least give your shoes a spray with a disinfectant spray before touching them and then put them in a designated spot where they won’t contaminate anything else in your house.

Maybe you should start listening, rather than getting angry with people for not telling you what you want to hear?

Masks *do* help to prevent sick people spreading the disease. That is thei traditional use (when you commonly see people in China wearing masks, *they're* sick not paranoid).

Right now, if you are sick, you could wear one. But then, if you're sick, you should stay at home, so it's kind of redundant.

Masks *don't* help prevent people from catching the disease. The disposable masks are a poor barrier, they should be changed regularly (hourly), people fit them improperly, and wearing one means you'll be touching your face more often than normal.

Unless you wash your hands every time *before* you fiddle with it, you're increasing your risk of infection. Like, seriously."

The market might usually be hundreds of thousands. But the populations are hundreds of millions of buyers.  So even if only 1% of the population is ""dumb"" and reacts, buying these,  that's a million new consumers, or 10x typical.

My point is, the nations isn't dumb - a typical percentage is. But that's enough to deplete the supply since it's still 10x or more than the usually buyer market."

I think it’s worth pulling out a few quotes so people do read the whole thing. It’s a mathematical projection of when the medical system runs out of capacity and we start having severe problems. 

> If we’re wrong by a factor of two regarding the fraction of severe cases, that only changes the timeline of bed saturation by 6 days in either direction. If 20% of cases require hospitalization, we run out of beds by ~May 2nd. 

> If only 5% of cases require it, we can make it until ~May 14th. 2.5% gets us to May 20th. This, of course, assumes that there is no uptick in demand for beds from *other* (non-COVID19) causes, which seems like a dubious assumption.

> As COVID19 cases saturate virtually every state and county, which seems likely to happen any day now, it will soon be irresponsible for all HCWs to not wear a mask. These HCWs would burn through N95 stockpile in 2 days if each HCW only got ONE mask per day. 

> Importantly, I cannot stress this enough: even if I’m wrong – even VERY wrong – about core assumptions like % of severe cases or current case #, it only changes the timeline by days or weeks. This is how exponential growth in an immunologically naïve population works.

> One more thought: you’ve probably seen multiple respected epidemiologists have estimated that 20-70% of world will be infected within the next year. If you use 6-day doubling rate I mentioned above, we land at ~2-6 billion infected by sometime in July of this year.

> But take the scenarios above (full beds, no PPE, etc, at just 1% of the US population infected) and stretch them out over just a couple extra months."

>Severe cases are defined as tachypnoea (≧30 breaths/ min) or oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or PaO2/FIO2 <300 mmHg. Critical cases are defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock or other organ failure that requires intensive care. About a quarter of severe and critical cases require mechanical ventilation while the remaining 75% require only oxygen supplementation.

Doesn't that suggest that there is some benefit to having an oxygen machine at home in case you're one of the 75% that only require oxygen supplementation?

From CNN's Andy Rose and Jon Passantino 

Hawaii has confirmed its first novel coronavirus case, according to state officials at a Friday news conference.

Governor David Ige said the patient is a Hawaii resident who traveled on the Grand Princess cruise ship, which is now in quarantine off the coast of California. 

It’s the seventh confirmed case tied to the cruise ship.

Ige said the Hawaiian patient disembarked in Mexico, but officials are aware that the cruise ship also stopped at four Hawaiian ports last month. 

The state is examining the manifest of Grand Princess passengers to contact those who stopped in Hawaii, asking that they self-quarantine, he said.

Other good news is the death rate is likely far lower than WHO estimates given most early deaths are biased towards the most susceptible populations: the elderly and already sick. Final death rates likely around 0.5% among those with symptoms.

Also, current growth rates are so fast only because no country has taken effectively proactive measures to stop it. We'll likely see mass closing and quarantines in the next few months, followed by a rapid slowing down of infection rates. Once people realize how much of a problem it is, the world will begin working together to curb the outbreak.

In the end this will likely kill hundreds of thousands of people, which is horrible, but the vast majority of those people will be old and would not have lived too much longer anyways. The best thing that we could get out of this crisis is a worldwide effort to ensure the continuity of civilization as we know it. This will result in massive pushes for better health oversight in the US and galvanize the effort for expanded health coverage. Millions of lives may be saved in the long run once countries understand the urgency of early symptom screening in curbing all-cause mortality. It'll be like the end of Watchmen, though instead of a giant squid it'll be a microscopic bundle of RNA that scares humanity forward."

We are immensely lucky, in a way, to have had this opportunity to fight a global outbreak against a virus that is formidable but still relatively non-lethal. Governments will learn a painful but necessary lesson from this. Many will die, life will change, but the consequences are not nearly as devastating as they would have been from a more lethal contagion. If we required a global wake-up call, SARS-CoV-2 was a fairly lucky one to end up with all things considered. It could have been much, much worse - a genuine human species eliminator - but this is not that.

Also it’s a good idea. My wife and I have a good amount but could use more. They are just hard to find. 


FYI masks are not still being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer. 

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

Depending on how your origin country is handling things, you may have difficulty re-entering your country if things get really bad in Puerto Rico while you’re there. If you are a US citizen, you still may have issues returning to the mainland if Puerto Rico has a surge in reported cases or even if cases at the festival are publicized.

What you describe is kind of the principle behind vaccination! Instead of low doses sometimes we kill the virus or just use the antibodies to teach our body's immune system.
If it happens slowly then yes it may be easier for your body to develop antibodies and systematically kill virus-controlled cells. Unfortunately we don't know too much right now about how our body reacts to Sars-CoV-2 yet in terms of making antibodies. Also a problem with these types of viruses: they accumulate mutations quickly to fight the body's natural defenses- meaning you could need vaccinations every few months or so when it has changed a lot.

Singapore for example is a small, stable, wealthy, technologically sophisticated country with one of the most advanced, accessible health care systems in the world. They’re doing a phenomenal job of managing their outbreak. If you get sick, you kind of want to be in a place like Singapore. 

Start taking away those advantages and you get a slower ability to respond. The US’s major issue here is having a very large and fractured health care system with multiple levels of bureaucracy.

In Wuhan, if you believe the government data and and personal reports, did successfully radically slow the spread by quarantining everyone for about 40 days. It seems like the worst may be over there.

Singapore’s draconian measures have also protected the population. Panic is pointless but organization and protest at the the lack of response by certain governments is valid. In then US we spent nearly a trillion on bank bailouts. Right now we’ve approved around 9 billion for this. It won’t be enough. 

Moreover, the supply chain interruptions are going to have an economic effect. Freak out? No I agree that’s not helpful. Suggesting only old and diseased people will be affected whether directly or indirectly? That’s a comparable degree of misinformation.

People need to pressure the government for further support but not feed into conspiracy theories or doomsday scenarios. This is manageable but it shouldn’t be dismissed as simply a threat to the elderly."

# Caution: Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients Are Changing at Admission

 Findings: From Jan. 16 to Jan. 29, 2020, 89 patients had been identified as confirmed COVID-19. Patients were assigned into two groups according to the admission date. 31 \[34·8%\] of the infected patients were admitted from Jan. 16 to 22, and 58 \[65·2%\] were admitted from Jan. 23 to 29. Most of the infected patients were women (45 \[77·6%\] of 58) during Jan. 23 to 29, but less female (14 \[45·2%\] of 31) before Jan. 23. Patients admitted with more systemic symptoms such as fever (21 \[67·7%\] of 31), fatigue (13 \[41·9%\] of 31), and myalgia (7 \[22·6%\] of 31) before Jan. 23. Greater proportion of patients (10 \[32·3%\] of 31) admitted before Jan. 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a small proportion (4 \[6·9%\] of 58) admitted after Jan. 23. Other symptoms such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness were not significantly different between two groups. In addition, the group admitted before Jan. 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 \[54·2%\] of 24), CD3 (11\[52·4%\] of 21), CD8 (9 \[42·9%\] of 21) cells and elevated SAA (18 \[75·0%\] of 24).

**COPD and other pulmonary diseases**\- These people already have poorly functioning lungs. A respiratory virus increases their risk of experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring artificial breathing support (a ventilator). These people's lungs are not well-equipped to handle the inflammation from a respiratory virus. 

**Diabetes, hypertension**\- these people usually develop kidney disease that increases their chances of developing acute renal failure after infection. Acute renal failure is BAD news.  They may also have underlying heart conditions that decide to act up (and maybe cause a heart attack) in the presence of infection. 

**Cancer**\- These patients may be taking medications for their cancer that cause immunosuppression as a side effect, making them much more susceptible to infection and potentially limiting their ability to be healthy enough to receive chemotherapy (thus allowing their cancer to go untreated). 

**Immune system disorders-** This one explains itself."

People with more advanced diabetes also typically have complications such as structural kidney damage, cardiovascular diseases like hypertension and dyslipidemia, and various other vascular changes. In addition, an acute illness such as a viral infection like coronavirus does a wonderful job of throwing your blood sugars out of whack as your appetite changes, etc. This puts diabetics at an increased risk of HHS (type 2)/DKA (type 1) or hypoglycemic events. 

Bottom line is that presence of these complications in a diabetic is expected to put them at an increased risk of succumbing to the coronavirus.

N95 or equivalent masks are the best, surgical marks are okay if you are not going to crowded places, and a bandanna or a scarf is better than nothing.
2. Get a bunch of 75% alcohol wipes and use them to disinfect surfaces in your home, office, etc and your belongings. 
3. Grab 2 weeks worth of food supplies as suggested by the Canadian federal health minister [https://globalnews.ca/news/6623400/coronavirus-stockpiling-canada/](https://globalnews.ca/news/6623400/coronavirus-stockpiling-canada/).
4. Wear a pair of glasses or googles. It keeps the droplets from your eyes.
5. Avoid touching things in public as much as possible. Don't shake hands with others, press elevator buttons with your elbow, that kind of stuff.

However, the biggest theory is that because South Korea is testing the most people out of anyone internationally, they're catching a lot of cases with extremely mild symptoms that only need some bedrest to get better from.

The reason the Diamond Princess and so many other cruise ships are having high infection rates is the same reason planes are breeding grounds for gross stuff. It's cramped, close-quartered, and often uses recycled air. Cruise ships often usually skew towards elderly populations, something that would also effect their numbers since that population is a higher risk.

South Korea also has a very good healthcare system, so I can guarantee anyone who needs treatment is getting very good treatment."

Most of the reason that hand washing and hand sanitization works is the friction that you create. The mechanical action of rubbing literally removes the virus from your skin. Rinsing with water afterwards is the superior way of removing viruses, which is why hand sanitizer is inferior to washing. 

Any soap that encourages you to mechanically rub your hands longer works. Dish soap. Bar soap. Liquid soap. Whatever you have access to.

Sanitizers operate by denaturing the protein shell of a virus so it cannot continue to survive. The alcohol has to be 70% though, and it's best to expose the virus for 60 seconds. That might require multiple pulls on your sanitizer."

It's related to the SARS virus that caused another deadly outbreak of respiratory disease Southern China in 2002-2003 (that one is named SARS-CoV).

Coronavirus is a name used to describe a related group of viruses with common characteristics and origin. The first coronavirus was discovered in the 60's, and most of them cause mild respiratory illnesses (i.e. ""common colds""), but some, like SARS-CoV and now SARS-CoV-2, can cause much deadlier disease. The name ""coronavirus"" is derived from the fact that under an electron microscope, coronaviruses look like a circle surrounded by a halo or a crown, and ""corona"" is the Latin word for ""crown.""

The name of the *disease* caused by the current virus is COVID-19, which is short for ""Coronovirus Disease 2019,"" since the disease first appeared in Wuhan, China in December of 2019."

First of all, a human vaccine has never been successfully engineered for diseases in the coronavirus family. They are very hard to develop vaccines for.

Second, once a vaccine is developed it will need to go through at least nine months of human trials.

Once it passes all of those trials, it will take time to build a manufacturing facility and produce enough vaccine to start distributing it worldwide.

I’d say the masks are the most important thing. In the US there is a huge misinformation campaign to tell the general public masks are dangerous and won’t work. The US only has three weeks of PPE stockpile and is reserving supplies for medical professionals and VVIP’s. 

Masks in the US are not currently being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer. 

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

Although coronaviruses are endemic in humans and infections are normally mild (such as the common cold, which is caused by human coronaviruses in about 15% of cases), cross-species transmission has produced some unusually virulent strains which can cause viral pneumonia and in serious cases even acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known by the provisional name 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is contagious in humans and is the cause of the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak, an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

COVID-19, as the disease will now be known, was decided on by the WHO, with the organization giving a number of reasons as to why it was chosen.

“WHO had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.

The virus is thought to have originated in the city of Wuhan in China, which led to it being frequently named the “Wuhan coronavirus,” or “Chinese coronavirus,” but neither of these were official names and some believe they may have contributed to discrimination against Chinese people.”

As of July 6, a total of 122 countries had reported 94,512 cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, 429 of which were fatal; in the United States, a total of 33,902 cases were reported, 170 of which were fatal.\*

News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

It's dangerous because it's a new virus that is pretty serious and can kl a lot of elderly and immunocompromised people. The nature of the symptoms and spread make it incredibly difficult to control. It's a real problem."

Basically if you’re a healthy adult in a developed country you’re most likely safe but the fear is that you’ll transfer it to somebody who would be more at risk to die from it. 

China basically walled off an entire province because of it and about 3,000 people have died so far there. It’s a big deal because even if it only kills the old and sick, the ease in which you can catch it could mean millions of people dead."

>Like any other country, we have a limited number of ventilators. IF this virus gets to that, we'll have to make some tough decisions. This is why it's important for the public to do their part and self quarantine, if necessary. But the government is taking steps to increase manufacturing capability / pace of ventilators. -Dr. Torres and Dr. Fair

I’d say the masks are the most important thing. In the US there is a huge misinformation campaign to tell the general public masks are dangerous and won’t work. The US only has three weeks of PPE stockpile and is reserving supplies for medical professionals and VVIP’s.

Masks in the US are not currently being shipped to stores. Particular industry sectors are having their orders fulfilled by distributors, however N95 masks and or respirators and or those that exceed that rating are controlled items in the US by order of the government. Non approved industry/general public stores are having their orders put on “back order” until the governments goal of stockpiling 500 million masks is met. Last I heard the stockpile was up to 60 million. General public will not see masks on store shelves until the 500 million stockpile is met. If you don’t believe me call an industry supplier. I called Grainer.

Also, masks are required and can save your life! When the virus is caught intrnasally (via nose) it allows for quick blood brain barrier passage and the virus replicates and stays by the brain stem. Infections where the virus is caught via facal-oral or conjunctival route will be lighter than those infected Intranasally.

Masks will be absolutely required!

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

Or Google your states current stats...they often tell how many cases are currently in testing. Insist that one of those being tested is a close contact, those names are not available to all doctors so they can't check your story at that exact moment. Put them in a liability situation, insist you volunteer at a senior center or meals on wheels. Are they going to want to wait for hours for a test result on a third party and risk a Kirkland situation? Insist you were on a cruise ship and returned a week ago. Take a person with you to document their action or inaction, but have that person be a trusted friend that will simply not communicate as to your travel history. By the time they figure out you were lying, the test will already be running, as most states have same day turn around. When confronted about lying, blame it on the fever. People do crazy things. Or just insist that you are still 100% sure you had contact. If enough people do this, their testing criteria will already be shot and the cat will be out of the bag as to true community spread, and they will be backed into a corner.

But this is 10x level beast compared to TB and due to virulence and difficulty of containing, comparing these two as similar level potential pandemic initiators is not very honest, in the current light of the evidence.

Future may prove otherwise, but we are not there yet. We work with what we have today."

More and more information is being released the more time goes on and wider groups of the population are tested for the Coronavirus. Initially the death rate was much higher (like 15% at the very beginning) probably due to the fact that the only cases being reported were severe/life threatening, those that warranted a visit to the hospital. However as China ramped up its surveillance it came to light that a lot of people had been infected but weren’t even aware (a simple cold etc) and so the death rate has continued to drop. In Wuhan it’s a little bit higher, I think like 3%, but that’s mainly due to the fact that Wuhan was at the forefront of the epidemic, they weren’t prepared for it and they were overrun with patients and so on. Outside of Wuhan province though the death rate drops below 1% in most places. Again I’ll try to find the link to South Korea situation!"

It does make sense to test people who've been exposed and people who they've been in contact with.

Like that nurse who cared for a known coronavirus patient and came down with symptoms herself.  She and everyone she's talked to since she was (probably) exposed should be tested without question.  And then when they find a case, they should repeat the process.

People presenting with symptoms should be tested without question, as well, and the.abive process should be related.

They shouldn't be testing the local hypochondriac.

But instead, some political appointees told that nurse she couldn't have it because she had PPE.  🤦🏻‍♂️ This is what happens when you hire for the loyalty of wealth, rather than demonstrated competence, and run the federal government like it's an episode of The Apprentice.

For a lot of the brands in use, the sensivity can be as low as 50 - 60% (meaning they will read negative falsely in as many as 40% - 50% of cases).  Specificity is high.  IF it reads positive, you can count on that -- you have the flu.  If it reads negative, you maybe have the flu and maybe don't.

The 2 week lag time doesn't mean new cases will slow down in 2 weeks. It means there are more and more people out there transmitting it without having been tested so there is an exponential number of people creating new virus hotspots as we speak- MORE cases in 2-3 weeks due to this.

I'm guessing this is a Diamond Princess passenger who tested negative before coming down with symptoms later and then just today tested positive.  The timeline works out.

Even if it does infect neurons it does not follow that it is ""with you for life"". I think you're maybe conflating it with herpes virus?

Herpes virus persists not just because it infects neurons, but because it integrates its (DNA) genome into the host cell genome. The virus is with you as long as the neuron survives (i.e. for life).

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses and do not integrate. This means the virus would be cleared by intra-cellular anti-viral immunity, irrespective of the lifetime of the host cell."

Absolutely! 

A local news paper did a story on a man who grew 100% of his food consumption for one year. He didn’t work, he just tended to what was essentially farming at this point.

It took a ton of space and all of this guy’s time. Also, lots of prep. He spent months just getting everything set up.

It’s just not realistic for most people, but I could see growing 5% to 10% of my food at home one day 😊"

I'm practicing common sense here (it seems like you're assuming people who wear masks will be idiots and won't wash hands) and anyone who is still going to be wearing masks despite the intense social pressure not to is still probably going to wash their hands because they are being vigilant. There is no reason why everyone can't do the same. Just tell everyone to do both instead of thinking for them and lie to people and tell them to disregarding masks completely.

He was at work for two days after we came back from Seattle before his symptoms started so the spread might already have happened. His work was completely freaked out and was inundating him with calls yesterday to get more information and trying to reach their own public health department to try and get him tested.

The only thing we can measure is confirmed testing, because there is no accurate way to measure actual cases.  Of course there are tons of variables - testing rate, R0, government reaction and behavioral changes, and seasonal weather changes.

But we can set some bounds and estimates based on previous outbreaks and current data compared to those previous outbreaks.

1. The ""best case"" scenario - this is a bad flu.   For the US, if we use 2017-2018 a the lower bound (for deaths) there were 45,000,000 cases of the flu 810 hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths (0.14% death rate).   [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) 
2. Worldwide cases and WHO estimates - 100,000 cases, 3400 deaths (3.4% death rate)
3. Diamond princess - 3700 passengers, 696 cases, 6 deaths (0.86% death rate)

Given the lack of a vaccine and higher hospitalization and death rates this should be worse than the flu.

Anyhow - my point in posting the numbers is that for countries that are just getting started, I had thought 2-3 weeks was the time frame for maximum fear and panic.  But for the US, April will probably be much scarier than March.  From an economic and financial standpoint, I underestimated the time frame for maximum fear and impact."

My hope is that we have enough food to subsist off of so that leaving the house is unnecessary by today’s end.

I’m a hypochondriac as is. I also had the flu three years ago and it was awful, took me two weeks to recover from. I cannot imagine what Corona would do, and I don’t want to know. I know that most people do end up recovering, but living in the US - we are woefully underprepared for something like this. Our local hospital gets overloaded. I was at the hospital almost three weeks ago for a possible concussion and nearly everyone was coughing (I wore a face mask in the hospital - most were there for presumably general flu stuff). People were waiting for hours. This was without (confirmed) Coronavirus in the area.

I was just wondering if this would be a way until vaccines are discovered to allow people to more safely contract the disease.   I read that zinc also surpressed the rate of replication, so the initial controlled exposure could possible utilize zinc further slowing down the rate of replication.  So picking a spot that is not the lung, using just a few viruses to start, and zinc so that the host gets as much advantage as possible."

This approach will.  We infect the host but in a way that gives them the most time to build up resistance.   Its a stop gap until a better approach is found.  
I'm sure the severity and location of the initial exposure has a big impact on how fast the infection starts.  The key here is to allow an infection but to do so in a way that allows the host the most advantage.  
Imagine you could infect your nail and then allow your body to start creating a defense and then you cut off the nail.   The key is to control the initial infection on purpose.  Now, I know nails are not really at target of infection but maybe there is something like it that can get infected and then have those cells be removed quickly."

God damn there’s a lot of people on this site that want to say “OOH OOH! Look at me! I care about people and this guy is a dick! Acknowledggggeee meeeeeee” 

Of course people should care. I’m just seeing a ton of people here and in the real world hyperventilating about it, like it’s the next pandemic that will wipe out the world. The facts are, we don’t know much about it, have no vaccine, and up until recently people infected with it weren’t identified as having it, separate from a different type of flu or cold. Even with all that, it’s still killing WAY less people than your standard flu virus, and WAY less people than Pneumonia. Also, I don’t know where you’re getting that you can become reinfected with it, other than one report out of Japan, and they think that was a testing error, and have found no evidence of reinfection with this strain. 

Moral of the story: take standard precautions to not get sick, be informed, but quit spreading panic."

### Wash your hands frequently

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

**Why?** Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.  


It doesn't really matter though how it works, all you need to know is that washing your hand thoroughly with soap for 20 seconds works.  Get between the fingers."

I think a lot is still up in the air, the jury is still out on much of this so i will probably err on the aide of caution. 

So what if you are the caretaker for an elderly parent or for someone who just had a lung transplant? What types of behavior changes would be required? My state hasn't any confirmed cases but I have started doing errands for my father and placing groceries inside the door of his home. I've recommended that he stop being visited by the chaplain on Sundays for the time being. This seems basic to me and not too hysterical. 

  If cruise ship passengers are getting it en masse, why should I not think it's  airborne? Has the health officials investigations looked into what those passengers were doing that might point to a commonly touched element like a tennis racket ?

That makes sense too, in the article itself (which I'm guessing some people didn't even actually read), it sounded like the local government was trying to make the higher ups think things were further along than they were whenever they would come to investigate. The whistle blower was saying that the ""full recovery"" being reported was fake and that they were still lagging behind the numbers expected by Beijing and were trying to cover it up. 


Makes sense that Beijing would be upset about that. It's also more about the local governments lagging behind CCP expectations than it is about ""China is still totally shut down and isn't doing anything anywhere""."

> Outside China, 2055 cases were reported in 33 countries. Around 80% of those cases continue to come from just three countries. 

> We see encouraging signs from the Republic of Korea. The number of newly-reported cases appears to be declining, and the cases that are being reported are being identified primarily from known clusters. 

> Although a few countries are reporting large numbers of cases, 115 countries have not reported any cases. 

> 21 countries have reported only one case. 
And 5 countries that had reported cases have not reported new cases in the past 14 days.

Oxygen saturation will drop to below 80% (the normal figure is 95+) and people can barely breath.  This is when life-support machine is really needed. Without timely medical asisstance many of the 20% will die during this phase. The mortality rate is 4% in Wuhan vs. below 1% in other province of China. This drastic difference is simply caused by the fact that outside of Wuhan hospitals are not overloaded.

So do not be fooled by the average 2% death rate. The true figure only depends on if there are enough beds in hospital to fight the disease.

Also I think it is dangerous to believe the virus only attacks elderly. Whistleblower doctor Wenliang Li died in his 30s."

Personally I dont see real negative effects in my surrounding, only disinfections are sold out, but supply coming monday. Here in Austria everyone discusses and jokes, but the tides are hight. Imo preventions (big scales quarantin) failed massively, probably to prevent mass hysteria and economy shutdown, but I trust in our experts on monitoring and care. Right now I think Israel will have the best prevention tactics at their borders, because they value the lifes of their citizens highest (my pers opinion due to their history). Italy struggles hard."

Quarantine yourself in your house. Eat junk foot all day and feel safe in your zone, but stop trying to control other people’s lives.

Theres evidence that it doesn't spread this way from the last SARS outbreak. Air China 112. An infected person was on that flight, and everyone who was infected by him was within 9 rows which is within range of sneezes, coughs. It was a massive plane and they were they only people to get it. If planes recirculated the way people think they do, you would've seen infection rates across the entire plane scatterplot around, but it was all within range of where the infected sat. Most was either contracted from a sneeze, or people walking on their way to the bathroom. 6 feet forwards or backwards on a plane is about 6 rows. On a 737 which this plane was, you would have nearly 40 individuals just within that 6 foot range. He only infected 20 people out of the entire flight."

My parents grew most of their own food for a time when I was a kid, but they bought a lot of the grains.  If I ever have to do a survival garden, potatoes are likely to be the starch of choice while I get good at the Three Sisters Method and start getting grains figured out.

(If you haven't encountered the Three Sisters method yet, it's a Native American way to grow corn, beans, and squash all together.  It's very efficient, and the plants compliment each other biologically and the flavors complement each other on the plate.  It doesn't scale well for commercial food production, but it makes a lot of sense for small-scale gardening.)

Please note I am not saying this is a bad thing, but rather that your opinion is incorrect. I get that folks want more information, however, there are a number of reasons that this information is private. I work for a very large company that has at least 95% of the (legal) population of the U.S. in our database. We track every time you visit a pharmacy (among many other things, if you have ever had a driver’s license or state ID card, we have you), even if you are just buying pseudoephedrine. Would you want us trumpeting around the fact you shit your pants every two hours? Of course not. We are not allowed to look at your information at all, both from a legal perspective and per company policy.

There are some nuances to this of course, but what you’ve described goes into the realm of PHI/PII so it isn’t allowed.

EDIT: I am sure you are probably wondering why the U.S. is allowed to report cases of not only COVID-19, but other illnesses if what I said is true, and the answer is that it is anonymized. There isn’t (to my knowledge) a hard and fast law on what is anonymous and what is not outside of HIPAA, however, a disease that will undoubtably make at least tens of thousands of people sick is different from an illness that makes 2 people sick. The laws generally are very strict, however there there is a few loopholes that allow for some data to be made public by certain parties.

The reason these laws exist is to block everyone in health insurance companies, big pharma, government, marketing agencies, etc. from contacting you."

Espousing literal nightmare scenarios where it's effectively doubling without taking into account a wide array of evolving information is far to simplistic of a calculation.  Here are just a few reasons;

Do we really think that the Diamond princess is a good conveyor of spread? How many population centers replicate the exact proximity and conditions of that ship? Densities will be a large variance and there is absolutely no population that replicates the behavior of a cruise ship, the closest I can even think of would be a college dorm.  Was the age of the passengers on that ship a mirror of the general population? Will children who show no symptoms become a much larger vector for the general population? 

The flu again, is not a good example, as it is actually more deadly for the youngest demographics, but doesn't seem to spread as effectively in some ways, plus we have some natural immunity and vaccines to it.  Where as Covid-19 seems considerably more deadly among the elderly.  

I think the WHO estimates are literally that, an estimate, the US has done such a poor job of testing and screening do we really have a clear picture?  Are there far more people infected that we don't know about due to the majority of individuals having only cold/flu like symptoms, or is it simply not spreading like it did in China for other reasons? 

There are also endless variables, we don't have the pollution or smoking rate of China so going by their death rate doesn't help.  Do we know if this virus attacks different genetic backgrounds in various manners? I've also seen a wide array of information on how long it can live on surfaces, and the factor into that sun, heat and humidity reduce it's virulance.  There are so many components that a simple estimate seems impossible to extrapolate."

As the virus replicates and is transmitted between people, imperfect copies are created. The mutations don't really change how the virus functions, but they do show the pattern of transmission.

Think of it like students copying homework from each other. Let's say Alex hands in some work to you. It's mostly good, but there's some weird typo. Later Bo hands in their work too...With the same typo. They probably wouldn't make the same mistake independently, so they must have gotten it from Alex. Bo also adds a new error as well. Later Casey hands in their work, with Alex's typo but not Bo's. Later still Dani submits their work, with the same typos as Bo --- so Dani must have gotten their work from Bo, not just straight from Alex.

The mutations are random corruptions, so with enough samples you can say how many mutations have occurred, and therefore how many copies the case is distant from the original. This tells you when the original transmission likely occurred."

Seasonal flu has cfr of 0.05% with a little over 0.8% for at risk population, leading to 300-600k death per year. This virus has, in the best case scenario a 0.6% cfr, and considering the likelihood of a large amount of infected cases, we may see the number of deaths increase dramatically. >18% cfr in the elderly. 

On top of it, considering the sloppiness in responding to the virus by the various governments, there's a high chance to have a health system collapse, leading to a much larger cfr (see first months in China, where their health system was saturated and overwhelmed... they got up to 15%!).

More like maybe part of the lung and then destroy, cut out,  the infection before it grows too much.  Thinking about it more,  it may be possible to locate a organ that has a slower rate of RNA replication so that the initial infection progresses slower then the lung.   The speed of replication is a function of the host cells speed of replication.  The virus just hijacks a tractor instead of a sports car.   So
1.  Use a very low viral count to create an initial infection
2.  Pick a cell type that replicates less aggressively.  
3.  Use zinc or some other materials that slows down replication. 
4.  Allow the body to create its own defenses but giving it as much advantage as possible. 
5.  Continue work on a vaccinate that does not require controlled infection."

Our policy on political posts is as follows:

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

I am disgusted at the leadership in the US and many other countries.  They are straight lying.  I was looking at the testing policy in my state (Michigan).  So far they claim to have only done about 8 tests.  They won't allow a test unless you have traveled to the affected area in China OR have documented proof that you were in direct contact with someone who was in the affected area AND has officially been diagnosed with coronavirus.  It is a scandal imo, they are deliberately trying to stop people from being tested to trick people into thinking there are no cases near them.

I have come to the conclusion that despite the knowledge of what will happen to people if they don't take more decisive action and force businesses to shut down and actually alert people to the serious risks; the government's have decided they may be better off just letting people die, so that presumably it is over quicker. 

 They should immediately pass emergency fiscal bills to pay people's wages temporarily while they quarantine.  If we do not do this soon and it gets out of control, millions will likely die.

The average person still thinks ""it's just the flu bro.""

This has 100% already spread unseen in numerous communities. Once widespread testing begins, hospitals will be quickly overrun. Shortages are inevitable and already happening for some items.

Many people will die from this. It is very probable that *you will catch this disease*, and even if you are young and healthy, if may have long-term health effects.

It should go without saying that anyone who has a chronic illness or is over 60 should *already* be well-stocked and should stay at home as much as possible.

I still think it is related to staffing issues and possibly change of shift times.  It is likely a staffing issue as you said, which in that case if you have a definite need to visit after 6pm, I would talk to administration about it. Hopefully you are in a State without any clusters/outbreaks.

I only see one sentence in this report that relates to oxygen.  It doesn't appear to be translated super well:

>3 days before death, the blood oxygen saturation decreased to 70% ~ 80%, the mask inhaled oxygen, increased the oxygen flow (40 L / min, oxygen concentration 60%), and the blood oxygen saturation increased to about 98%.

Do you think you could translate just that sentence (and any other surrounding sentences that are also relevant to oxygen)?

For context, I am thinking about buying an oxygen concentrator for my elderly parents as a backup plan in case the hospitals are all full.  They can share it if they don't need it.  I don't think an ""oxygen concentrator"" and a ""ventilator"" are the same thing.

It's a scary situation because we just don't know much, and for me and many others, not knowing is one of the most stressful situations to be in.

Combine that with people here on reddit throwing around rumors and theories that are mostly pretty terrible and ""worst case"", and its so easy to get sucked into despair. 

**What I have decided for myself is the following:**

- Be prepared...not panic buying and hoarding, but making logical decisions on supplies. This can help because it's something we can actually do right now to help our families.

- I remember that there have been so many things that were said to be gigantic apocalypse-like events that turned out to be nowhere near as bad as what people feared initially. This is not to dismiss the seriousness of the situation or the fact that we just don't know a lot at this point...but situations are rarely as bad as what many people fear at the outset. Again, this doesn't mean this can't end up bad, but things very often do not work that way. This allows us to be prepared but still not overly stressed out.

- I am limiting my reddit time regarding this situation. I want to be informed, but the fact is that MANY people on reddit and on this subreddit, are throwing around theories and rumors as facts. The real fact is, no one knows much at this point. That is a little scary in and of itself, but it also means that a lot of the wild ideas flying around are just rumors/theories, EVEN those stated by doctors are at this point only suppositions. I think within the next 2 or 3 weeks we will have much better first hand information from watching cases here in the US (if you are in the US this is relevant).

- The numbers from South Korea are encouraging in my opinion. The death rate is lower, the hospitalization rates are lower, and they have not resorted to the draconian levels that China used. They have been testing 10 thousand people a day and are supposed to be pretty transparent with reporting, so their numbers give a good idea of what the reality is. My hope is that we in the US will ramp up testing in the next week or two and follow their lead. 


Just do what you can logically to prepare and try not to stress over what you have no power over...easier said than done, but that is the key. Also definitely consider talking to a counselor or someone you trust to help work through some of the anxiety - it sounds dismissive to say that but it really does help. The next few weeks will most likely give us a lot more information which will help with the rumors and the anxiety."

How many people cough into their hand, pick their nose, *lick their finger*, handle their phone after it's been near their mouth. 

Then they go touch that doorknob, and so do many others.

""Drooling on doorknobs"" is a pretty limited viewpoint the how contagions can enter the environment.

> infecting others is still very unlikely except to those who are very very close to you. Sneezing and coughing have always been the most common infection route. The average influenza case does show symptoms after 2 days, but it can incubate for as long as a week in some cases.

 sneezing and coughing expelled particles don't just magically disappear as soon as they leave your mouth. They are deposited on the environment, and that's why masking culture is so prevalent in Asian population centres. It's controlling the outwards spread to the environment as a way to limit everybody's chance of being infected."

Until we really know how many people are getting the virus, we won't know anything about its mortality.

We can put a nearly definite cap on what it is, based on the number of known deaths over the number of known cases, but the number of known cases is far more likely to be low and if that number goes up while deaths are the same, mortality is lower.

Do we act in moderate way, and show children as role models, that we are level headed even in difficult circumstances, or should we lose our heads over this?

Just a basic thought on how we want to be perceived and how we want our children to lead their lifes in future.

For me personally, causing fear and panic in children is more unforgiving. It gives signal, that we as grown-ups are afraid of a virus. I would say, even if it should hit me, it is still better to die in dignity, than creating panic in young adoscelents.

I understand your thinking here. If a patient is asymptomatic they're not coughing and sneezing and they're not expelling particles in bulk.


However a symptomatic person is most likely engaging in some sort of activity limitation due to their symptom. Maybe taking a day off from work or avoiding extracurricular activities due to feeling unwell.


While the asymptomatic person while contagious is still engaging in normal social activities. Let's say the culture is one that's more physical in close contact like some European cultures.


You can avoid someone who is symptomatic you cannot avoid someone who is asymptomatic."

I don't want to cause a panic, but fear is not always irrational, especially at a time like this. I think what is really unforgivable is keeping schools and businesses open knowing that it will enable more sickness and death.

If we don't act now, the situation will only get worse as will the panic you are describing. Yes, solving a problem of this magnitude requires acknowledges it and that will scare some people, but I'd rather scare ten people and solve the problem than wait a month and scare a thousand more.

Closing schools ahead of time is one way to prevent disasters and *prevent panicking*. I’m from Florida. You don’t close schools for a hurricane threat during a hurricane. You close it beforehand, so that people aren’t putting themselves in needless danger.

Waiting until a positive case shows up would potentially expose multiple children and adults to the disease. Those children would then go home to their parents and spread the disease to them. Those children could potentially visit their grandparents, and spread the disease to them. Those children could potentially have immune compromised relatives...you see where this is going.

 I'm wondering this for a couple of reasons. First, according to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-facts-what-is-the-mortality-rate-and-is-there-a-cure-covid-19) there is no known cure, but the treatment they describe sounds a lot like HIV and Herpes treatment options. Second, There is [a mechanism](https://stdcarriers.com/registry/search.aspx) in place to help warn the public about known carriers of STDs, so it might make sense to apply a similar approach to Coronavirus."

Yes, in most cases at the state level declaring an emergency allows the state more discretion in reallocating funds.  A lot of states have a set budget and can't switch bound money for emergencies without declaring a ""state of emergency"".

Having a governor declare a state of emergency can open it up to Federal funding and support from FEMA (although this isn't always guaranteed).

For example if Massachusetts was to declare a state of emergency we could:

* declare a travel ban
* allow for the automatic closure of schools, businesses and government offices
* issue executive orders that may override laws for the existing disaster"

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy\_in\_pre-Columbian\_America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy_in_pre-Columbian_America)  
There is a wealth of evidence in support of metal ""plates"" in pre-colombian America. If you want things that are properly bizarre, LDS beliefs about homosexuality are supremely more fucked up and much more immediately harmful.

Similar to believing whether Moses or Jonah were literal people is irrelevant now, you could list a lot of bizarre fucked up stuff (Some fun things to read about that you might be interested in):  
Joseph's masonic heritage, the Jupiter pendant, Celestial Dynastic Marriage--which is unique from polygamy, but that too, anything Bruce R McConkie has ever said, journal of discourses, Urim and Thummim, Plurality of gods, the idea of God's Wife--as well as a race of gods, people living on the sun, Bigfoot is Cain, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam  


But any crazy really pales in comparison to harmful beliefs or gaslighting that happens on a much more subtle, and sometimes not so subtle (looking at you BYU) level. Not many people associated with the church are malicious in any way. Most of them either do or don't believe in the crazy stuff. Im okay if none of it is ""real"" as long as it makes people better and gives them a community to help people, but from what I've seen, I've found the opposite. I think it has hurt too many people I care about."

Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America is the extraction, purification and alloying of metals and metal crafting by Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European contact in the late 15th century. Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155–1936 BCE, and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would have been found in nature without need for smelting techniques and shaped into the desired form using heat and cold hammering techniques without chemically altering it by alloying it. To date ""no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America."" In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed.

This sub could be entirely filled with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often.

Unfortunately, as I'm sure you know, there can be slightly different ""flavors"" of Christianity, who may be more lax or strict on certain rules and traditions. He was under the impression that God would only protect him if he kept going to church. He's a young guy, so again, not the best example. 

Thank you for doing the right thing. I'm personally not a believer, more agnostic on the ""I just don't know enough to know"", but if there is a God, I'd like to believe he certainly helps those who help themselves. That is, if you prioritize keeping others safe, I don't exactly think missing a service or two goes down as a red mark, y'know?

If you don't mind me asking, I assume US (apologies if wrong), what state do you live in? I'm currently in MD, and I've seen some... more extreme ideals surrounding Christianity in this area.

How about people just only do essentials required to survive. Get food, water, essentials, button up. Don't forget pet food. There is absolutely no medical reason to go outside unless you're getting tested, and you should call the nearest center/hospital before you even do anything.

Believe me, I understand more than anyone what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck, and sweating this, don't want to hear it. I'm damn near 100% certain I won't have a job in a couple months, that's cool, I'm still alive.

Now you're jumping to an entirely different argument, which really should come down to the issues of (a) where are we now in the spread of the virus and (b) what's the most effective response to slow and mitigate the disease so as to (as best as possible) flatten the spike of new cases that can overwhelm hospitals and create a higher mortality rate. 

Aaaand then you jump even further to imply that I'm arguing for everyone to shelter in place, which is a staggering leap from my simple correction to your legally incorrect statement.

PS I never made any such argument, but if you're curious, yes, I think you'll find that large public sporting events and gatherings (like sxsw) will start being cancelled (possibly not the event, but forbidding atendees in the stands, etc). There's nothing really controversial about that; it's just obvious and basic public health policy in the midst of pandemic."

Luckily, I already helped them before this blew up, and they're taken care of for at least a month, I made sure of that. Sometimes being prepared makes a huge difference.

I already had a months worth of necessities stocked up which helped a lot. I just never assumed things like this were impossible, and prepared the best I could for situations that would be out of my hand. I've been in that situation where I didn't prepare, and had let others down, so I guess I was lucky to learn my lesson early.

You do you, but please be as safe as possible, just as you're taking care of those you love, you could equally be putting them at risk. The reality is, everyone in this thread techinically *could* be infected, and we might not know for a week or two, that's been on my mind heavy lately, and has really changed my perspective on what is absolutely necessary. I personally would feel extremely guilty if I got someone sick, friend or not. That being said, I would gladly sacrifice my health if it would help someone I cared about, and would never hold it against them if they got me sick, or I exposed myself in an emergency where absolutely no other alternative was available.

This isn't an emotionally easy situation, as no serious world-changing emergency is.

Not with that attitude, obviously. Personal responsibility goes a long way.

How can they if no one is working there? If airlines are failing and we cannot ship goods? I'm prepared with a months supply of food. Not pretty, but I'll survive.

Walmart has nothing I need. I never have less than a months worth of food (restricting calories is always an option!). Part of being prepared for my ""shit's out of my hand"" plan. Just a small guarantee I can take care of myself an help another person out a bit in events like these.

Is it really a kneejerk reaction? Because I'm staring down the largest pandemic and overall global shutdown we've ever seen in modern times. I guess my knee-jerk reaction to prepare with a months supply of food/water and essentials, while also making sure those I care about were prepared too was kneejerk?

There's no excuse to go outside for anything other than the bare necessities. You can take whatever words out of context you want, imply whatever. Bottom line is, I'm safe, prepared, and not going to put anyone else in danger. That is my top priority, anything else is not important to me currently. The world will keep spinning."

We have no idea how many total cases there are of COVID19. There could be tens of thousands of non-reported cases with various outcomes.

Meaning? Most infected are 20s young women, a demographic very unlikely to die frim this.

Also, this means they can trace and test easily, and catch a lot of people in their incubation period. Since Covid-19 takes about 5 days to develop symptoms and another 2 weeks to get worse, a lot of these cases just haven't reached that phase yet.

Remember, out of the ~7000 cases in SK, only ~160 has an outcome. And of them, 115 recovered and 45 dead.

Since there is limited treatment for this, early detection slows down the spreading but don't  always helps recovery. Avaluable medical assistance helps recovery.

And, those on cruise ship etc. who were asymptomatic-at-time-of-detection, often later develope symptoms. The man who dead was not the one who addmited as a critical case, that was why they were confusion regarding his gender! Anyway, people on that cruise received care upon detection, and they were health enough to enjoy a vacation. I would expect a 1~2% mortality rate, so 7~14 out of the whole ~700.

As of the cases in China. Thoes earliy mortality rate in Wuhan (~15%) was definatly higher than normal, becaus it also started blowing up in hospitals and longtime care centers. Worse, there were no treatment guidlines or knowledge of the virus at the time.

If you look at the timeline in China. They kept it quiet, which allowed ~5 million people, who were basically visitors in Wuhan, leave for home on Jan 22nd on Spring Festival Break. But the day after, on Jan 23rd, they lock Wuhan down, and asked those 5 million to self-quarantine and seek treatment.

4 million went to other parts of Hubei, the provincen where Wuhan was the capital of. 1 million went outside Wuhan.

Turns out the morality rate was very low outside of Hubei. But these people were quarantined and received free treatment if necessary. Two or three teams of top experts were avaliable per patient, because they very much wanted to learn about this virus. There never was any large  outbreak outside Hubei. So with enough testing, free healthcare, top of the line treatment, and a young pool of patients made up of collage studients and migrant workers, the mortality rate was about 1%.

And Hubei recived 13 billion Yuan (~2 billion USD) ,~40000 health care worker (making it 1 HCP per 2 patients) , thousands of ventilator (made in China during the outbreak), 2 new hospitals (built during the outbreak) and 20+ quarantine centers. Wuhan, by the way, is a port turned big healthcare town. Think Pittsburg but bigger (which is the sister city of Wuhan). So it is what an outbreak would look in such a town with the amount of resource it recived, and the mortality rate would be about 5%.

Again, we have no prof that a lot of people can STAY asymptomatic during the whole course of Covid-19. We tested large amount of healthy people in China at flu servey center, to see if they were carriers, and they were not. We traced more than 650,000 contacts. They either were virus free or they developed symptoms---some after several weeks.

So this supposed iceberg theory of  large amount of asymptomatics just has no data supporting it. 

Some good news is that South East Asia is doing better than expected, so maybe hot weather does help. And again, several HIV and Ebola (both also retro-virus) medication has shown to be some what effective against this virus. So doctors now have at least some treatment.

Containment is key because once you run out of resources, mortality rate is going to go up. Hospitals, longterm care centers, large detention centers, countries with older population and countries where people don't usually wore masks are especially vulnerable."

&#x200B;

One possible way to counter it would be to expose large amount of healthy individual in the low death rate group (ideally identifying those with higher risk of death, and exclude them) to the virus and therefore creating herd immunity (works with virus that doesn't mutate too fast too often, coronavirus likely fits the case)

&#x200B;

i.e. don't delay, but speed up the virus spread among healthy population in the low death rate group.

&#x200B;

This is likely to minimize total deaths across the globe. Basically contracting the live virus itself for the low risk group is equivalent to a relatively speaking higher risk vaccine.

&#x200B;

Quarantine at this stage is futile. You end up with tail cases from other country to start another round of outbreak.

&#x200B;

The only hope with quarantine is the virus somehow subsides with change in weather, but it's not a given. The possible scenario by quarantine would be lengthening the time needed to reach herd immunity, perhaps with also increased risk of mutation."

Flu killed healthy males/females ages 25-35 within one day of showing symptoms back in 1918-19.

I get the coronavirus is bad, but this chart is irrelevant data to compare to each other side by side.

One thing: the flu vaccine is administered to most children at a young age and they’ve had many ((many many)) days to develop an immunity.

To compare that last statement to today’s data,
1) the flu now compared to an outbreak is not comparable because we are medically prepared for the flu
2) vaccines take time for the recipient to actually develop an immunity to the vaccine
3)  there are more factors giving the corona an advantage to the flu with rate of spread and asymptomatic spread.
But we are more medically advanced. 

An immunity is not likely to occur during the next year or two. To develop a vaccine, they have to have test trials on an agent infected, and there are many variables and factors, and the vaccine has to be good to go without a doubt to be administered to 100s of millions.

I’ve spoke to someone who worked in drug development and, although not in the corona vaccine department, he said 2 years minimum and that’s at an accelerated pace. 

The flu was detrimental, the left graph could not be expressed accurately even if you wanted to now because the book keeping was extremely poor, and they estimated 30-50 million dead but some argues 100 million."

For COVID-19 it is not.  Sensitive and specific testing for it requires test kit and the means to do RT-PCR analysis (looking directly at the genetic sequence).  The test kit has only recently ramped up in production after initial batch had QC problems with the reagents.

The CDC is working on a serology test (they look for antibodies) which would make it more widely available.  However, I have serious questions about specificity since there are many other coronaviruses already and it’s not clear that serology test will be able to distinguish between them. 

Thus, if you have test that isn’t widely available with test kits that are hard to come by, we’re not likely going to have an accurate representation of the disease incidence/prevalence.  Thus, the mortality rates are at best useless, and at worst, misleading."

I think the Diamond Princess gives quite an accurate look at the undetected and asymptotic cases. It seems like ~40% of the patients are asymptotic so we can probably cut the current CFR by half.

With the flu, people go see their doctor who flags it as such pretty easily, so we have a very wide sample and thus a low mortality rate. 

With COVID19, we have every single death in the numerator, but the denominator doesn't yet include every person that actually has it (because we haven't tested). 

I hope this make sense."

There is one FAQ on that page that answers the question, but I'm not going to quote it, because the key part of the answer is that **there is little information at this time**.

I had asthma as a child.  When I was sick with the cold/flu, it was always far more serious with me than with others.  Having breathing issues from asthma makes dealing with breathing issues from being sick that much worse.

I outgrew my asthma... either through environmental changes, exercise, or whatever, and now I'm in great physical shape for someone my age.  I've done triathlons and marathons, and hiked all the way across Switzerland.  Still though, when I get sick, it hits me harder than most people... I think.  It may be that I'm just more aware of my situation and take it more seriously.  

Anyway, read what that source has to say, take the advice very seriously, and don't assume asthma + Coronavirus = death."

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

Meaning? They catch a lot of people in their incubation period. Since Covid-19 takes about 2 weeks to develop symptoms, a lot of these cases just haven't reached that phase yet.

Remember, out of the ~7000 cases in SK, only ~160 has resolved. And of them, 45 dead and 115 recovered.

Since there is no treatment for this, early detection slows down the spreading but wouldn't helps recovery. Avaluable medical assistance helps recovery.

And, those on cruise ship etc. who were asymptomatic-at-time-of-detection, would later develope symptoms. The man who dead was not the one who addmited as a critical case. That was why they were confusion regarding his gender! Anyway, people on diamond princess received care upon detection, and they were health enough to enjoy a vacation. I would expect a 1~2% mortality rate, so 7~14 out of the whole ~700.

Again, we have no prof that a lot of people can STAY asymptomatic during the whole course of Covid-19. We tested large amount of healthy people in China at flu servey center, to see if they were carriers, and they were not. We traced more than 650,000 contacts, and tested them. They either were virus free or they developed symptoms---some after several weeks. So this supposed iceberg theory has not data support.

If FLU in Germany right now has a 17% hospitalization rate you don't have FLU, you already have COVID-19. What is your source, it sounds WAY off.

In America:

"" CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010. ""

[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:\~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20influenza%20has,61%2C000%20deaths%20annually%20since%202010.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20influenza%20has,61%2C000%20deaths%20annually%20since%202010.)

To calculate that for you, if it was 9,000,000 infections with 140,000 hospitalizations,  that is a 1.5% hospitalization rate.

Another example. CDC estimates   35,520,883 cases of flu in America this year and  490,561 hospitalized. That's a 1.4% hospitalization rate. Many hospitals are struggling to even handle our current flu patients, so imagine when COVID with a 10-20% hospitalization rate (5x-10x flu) come through, and they are coming en mass because the virus is more infectious, and they aren't leaving as fast as flu patients.

So in other words, if Germany really does have 17% hospitalization rate from flu rn now, yall either misdiagnosing COVID patients as flu patients or there two deadly illnesses going around there, because the highest hospitalization rate I could find for flu in America in the last 10 years (if you don't believe me look at the CDC link I shared) was 2014-2015 and it was a 1.9% hospitalization rate."

On the south Korean rates, 0.6% is optimistic. That's what you get by dividing the amount of deaths by the total of confirmed cases. The problem with this is that newly infected patients haven't had the time to get sick and die yet. With exponential growth of infections, these can artificially suppress the mortality rate by a lot.

 If you take only the deaths versus the number of recovered patients, you get a much higher rate of 20+%. This is obviously overshooting, since it's usually faster to die of a disease than to recover. However, the discrepancy between 0.6% and 20+% really shows that it's too early to tell.

COVID-19, however, appears to have a MUCH higher hospitalization rate than the flu, according to the WHO:

>Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). ([Source](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

So it appears that we're dealing with a 1.38% flu hospitalization rate vs a 19.9%+ COVID-19 hospitalization rate (of known cases). Unless we're missing a huuuuuuge swath of unknown COVID-19 cases, I think the data appears to be pretty accurate. And this is what the WHO has to say on the rate of asymptomatic cases:

>Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.  ([Source](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

Especially considering the magnitude of difference, the comparison should be blatantly obvious. Look at the data and use common sense and you'll be fine.

If you knew the total number of cases was accurate you could better predict the rate by looking at infections from 3 weeks prior. But of course the total number of cases will not be accurate unless you have very thorough testing. 

I think the closest we will get to a controlled experiment will be the final results from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Every one of those passengers was tested so we know the ratio of mild to severe cases and over time the ultimate CFR will be determined. Probably a bit too early to know what it will be as some people only tested positive at the end of February so there will be a bit of lag to final outcomes. Out of 4,061 tested 705 were infected (including 392 asymptomatic cases at the time they tested positive - some of these may have since developed symptoms.) Of the 705 total infected 7 have died. The main problem with extrapolating from this data is the skewed demographics of cruise passengers but I suspect that for a similar cohort this will be quite representative of the severity of the disease in a best case scenario. All of these patients likely would have access to good medical care and most will have had very early medical interventions that would not be the case for someone showing up in an ER with severe symptoms already.

Like you said, 6 have died. But another 34 are in serious condition.   

I’m not a doctor so take this next part with an Everest sized grain of salt. I read that “serious” cases are cases in which the person is put on a ventilator and once you’re on a ventilator odds are that you’re not going to survive.   

So assuming that all 34 of the serious cases end in death (which very well may be a ridiculous assumption to make on my part) the mortality rate would be 5.7%  

Additionally, with a total of 696 infected, 6 dead, 34 in serious condition, and only 40 recovered you still have 616 people sick with the virus and we don’t know what will happen with all of those cases. Most will likely recover. But how many will not?   

You’re spot on with your assumption that most of the people on the ship are likely older though, which will certainly skew the number up.   

Unfortunately this is a wait and see situation. We won’t know any reliable numbers until everyone on that ship has either recovered or died."

Also using the diamond princess petri dish as a data point, there were 1.1 asymptomatic cases per every symptomatic case.

Of course this disregards the % population infected, and related, the number susceptible.  A flu season typically has 10-20% infected, COVID-19 estimates are all over the map from what I can tell, between 20-80%.

Unmitigated infections grow exponentially, and so is the cost of slowing or stopping the disease as the contagion grows. From a public health perspective, the best you can do to avoid a catastrophe in the presence of uncertainty is to be as drastic as possible during the first signs, and adapt very conservatively as more information becomes available.

A big problem is how to be 'as drastic as possible' without raising damaging panic. It is hard, because we mostly react to individual risk, and not systemic risk, which is where public health officials target their messages. In this case, individual risk seems low, but the systemic risk is definitely worrying."

First, they're detecting more mild cases, which implies real death rate is lower than we've previously suspected: great! Second, people will get treatment earlier, which might well materially reduce death rate, which is good for other countries only if they follow suit. Third, they might be detecting cases earlier, which are currently mild but might get worse, thus meaning that the underestimation of death rate from the group who haven't died *yet"" is more severe.

The R0 value of the flu is 2-3 and the R0 of COVID is showing as between 1.4 - 3.8. 

Now think about when the flu is in your area and you know several people that have gotten it. I bet you probably didn't. 

However, we also have to take into account that nobody has immunity to COVID since it is new, so it is probably ""easier"" to catch than the flu, which we're exposed to constantly. 

Just take some precautions and realize that the vast majority of cases have relatively mild illness. Not going to say that it won't be miserable, but the chances of you ending up in the hospital are pretty small unless you have some kind of pre-existing condition. 

Try to do as much as you can to minimize the risk to others. Wear a mask if you feel sick, even if you aren't sure if it is COVID, sanitize your shopping cart if you go shopping, use hand sanitizer when you get into your car from any public place, etc. If we all do this, we can significantly slow down the spread of COVID.

Why do you think Chinese factories are using power but producing nothing? My coworker is from Wuhan and she tells me people are still in their houses.  They are _hiding_ from this virus on government orders, while the CCP tries to keep everyone's confidence as #1 trade partner, including for the US.

You either quarantine everyone or you have a _historic_ shitshow.  Those are the options.  Which one do you think the US chooses?

Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.

See, just before they were making things more ridiculous than they have to be, they were making things far less ridiculous than they already are. The problem is that the public discourse seems to recognize only two extremes: ""it's just the flu"" and ""we're all gonna die, kill your way to the toilet paper"".

And so everyone is shoved in one of those two extremes, all subtlety is lost. Case in point:

> We don’t lose our shit over extremely bad cases of the Normal flu... because the deaths and everything going on appear to be EXTREMELY Similar.

You cover the ground above very compactly. Two options ""we lose our shit"" or ""it's very similar to bad flu"". How about neither? Cautious doesn't mean ""panicked"". But also ""hope"" through ignorance of facts we do know is not a strategy.

> But shutting down schools, cities, events, etc. is extreme overkill at this point.

I can't disagree more. First of all, shutting down schools, events, planned (non-critical) surgeries are normal epidemic measures which are applied every year precisely for regular flu. If officials didn't do that, the ""Normal flu"" would be worse than it already is.

These measures have to be PROACTIVE in order to be effective. We actually have hard data on this, including at 1918 for cities which thought ""it won't come to us"" or ""it's just the flu"" (didn't close schools etc.: high death rate), vs. those who knew what's about to happen and closed them early (over twice lower death rate).

And even if we can't pinpoint the exact numbers on COVID-19, we know it does a whole lot more than regular flu strains. Including things like infecting your nervous system, kidneys, heart, causing blood clotting and infarctions, and being extremely infectious during a long incubation period.

Even in South Korea which seems to test every living thing under the sun, COVID-19 has 6 times higher mortality than the flu, and the vast majority of people haven't recovered yet (means from the same sample of infected people, more will die).

This is about being informed and appropriate in our actions. While politicians are explaining their pseudo-intellectual B.S. about how it's all about the economy, leaving this virus unchecked due to lax measures will not only kill and permanently damage untold number of people more, but also screw up the economy even worse in the end."

I think a lot of the water bottle collectors are -- aside from the rare oddballs who've already been waiting for the apocalypse for years -- people who only just realized this is bad. Unlike those in your/my position (having gotten important stuff early), they haven't had any time to think about what they'd *realistically* need. 

It's a lot easier to make reasonable choices when you know you have time.

There’s a sign posted at my local Costco, limit of 5 cases; each case with 8 cans of spam. In the brochure they send out, it’s down to limit of 4. That suggests a widespread and collective hoarding of spam. 

Even without the time to rationalize and prioritize though, right next to the spam and rice in their respective aisle, are usually entire aisle fulls of other canned goods and sauces, and pasta and dried snack foods. 

But people also definitely wouldn’t need to be irrationally hoarding if those who have the ability and / or the responsibility to have acted on this before we got to where we are now, did the responsible thing. Everyone from mainstream media outlets, CDC and WHO, leaders in governments around the world and especially China, are complicit in the spread of this virus. 

The whole situation feels like a widespread issue of too many people not looking for information that doesn’t affect them immediately and outside their bubble, plus putting too much trust in government and authority figures and both having too much complacency. Then overreacting when it’s too late. 

My parents are just like this and I worry for them. They haven’t reached the panic stage yet and have done zero preparation and maintain their plans to be out in public with seemingly no contingency or alternate plans in place.

I have no idea if spam is sold out here. I didn't look for spam, because I've never eaten spam in my life and I'm not going to start now. If I ever eat spam, it will be cooked by someone who knows what to do with it. 

Do you live somewhere where spam is really popular, or is this just a bunch of people hearing that you should have spam in your cupboard on doomsday? 

My ex (my daughter's dad) listened to me when I told him to get enough stuff for in case he needs to stay inside for a few months. He's a germaphobe anyway so convincing him didn't take any effort on my part. But guess what he ordered when it comes to food? 600 cans of soup. I find that hilarious. Soup for breakfast, soup for lunch, soup for dinner, soup for dessert... soup for your midnight snack... 

Did you/were you able to get anything extra for your parents, or do they live too far away for you to do that? Do you think that being emotional and even begging them to prepare might motivate them at least a little just to placate you? I know some people are impossible. 

I share your hope that, after this, people will have learned a lot about being prepared and asking more questions."

We (the U.S.) cannot conclude that we have the highest death rate, because we don't have enough data for that yet. The lack of testing has inflated this percentage. Because so few people have been tested so far (due to the amount of time it takes to manufacture and prepare test kits, plus the fact that only \~350 people can be tested in any batch of kits sent out,) our data pool is still small. There could be plenty of people who are still asymptomatic or are experiencing a milder case of COVID-19, who simply have not been tested yet, either because they haven't thought to go in for testing, because local governments have been encouraging people to stay at home unless your doctor requests you get tested, or because their local docs don't have enough testing equipment yet.

It's simply too early to determine an accurate mortality rate for the virus. For now, let's all just try to limit its spread by practicing hygiene responsibly \^\^

Within the past two weeks a local health department told a patient to go about his business after he reported travel to an area with high rates of transmission. My practice told him to self quarantine x14d but since the health department disagreed he went to work. 

He was sick a few days later with cough and fever but not sick enough for hospitalization and the local health department refused to screen him. 

He was evaluated in the hospital and we felt testing was warranted. The local health department initially refused because while he was febrile, coughing and had returned from a high risk area he wasn’t short of breath so he didn’t meet the case definition. 

After some back and forth they ultimately acquiesced and agreed to testing. The next day they told us the state health department had cancelled the test.

As much as I am critical of the US response, You can’t make that statement and know anything about basic statistics.    Law of small numbers says you will have extremes.    Could be big.  Could be small.  We need a larger sample space of confirmed cases to get a more accurate CFR.  And in the end, with community spread the rates will be much lower.   And probably different than China.  And China will be different than other countries.  

That’s partially because of demographics.   Countries with older populations, obesity, social customs that exacerbate community spread, poor public health systems will have higher overall CFRs.   

Another reason is that at the beginning of any local outbreak the most sickly present first.   So there is a wave of critical patients.   Over time, the number of non critical patients gets identified.   

So it’s a numbers game.   The first patient to show up with a novel disease either lives or dies.  If they die the CFR is 100%.  If they live it’s 0%.   The next patient shows up - and same outcomes.  So now the rate can be 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100%.   Depends on the permutations.    

It could easily happen that the first 99 patients identified all live and the next one dies.  CFR is 1%.   Then the next 99 die.   CFR 50%.  

Again.  Sample space too small.   We know what the CFR is with the flu.  And using CFR by country for the flu will give a pretty good estimate of which countries have a solid public health system.   And it will also tell you something about demographics.  You need lots of data.  Millions of cases.  

See.  It’s a math problem."

Which is really meaningless.  The number of reported cases isn't anywhere near the actual number of cases, and there's really no telling what the actual number of cases is.  Too many variables go into ""reported cases"" to even draw a comparison between countries.  So I don't know why this meaningless ratio is being labeled as the ""death rate.""  Tell me total deaths."

As someone currently living in California, we've been trying to make enough Corvid tests to try and start REALLY hardcore testing people. We've been working with the folks in Washington who made the tests up there. Honestly the west coast is trying as best as they can with NO FUCKING SUPPORT FROM OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. Mike Pence is just sitting on his ass. The CDC is trying to get their funding, but it might honestly be too late. 

The spread might be worse up here in NorCal than we even understand because *this virus has a spread ratio of one person infecting an estimated four people.* Do the math. Compared to the standard flu, which is 1 person to maybe 1.5 people, Corvid-19 gets FOUR PEOPLE. And it's insanely transmittable. So those four people can go infect four more people in their lives. Wait maybe a few days, two weeks at the most and BOOM you got Coronavirus on your hands and you're probably beginning to panic. You got it; who gave it to you? How many people did you infect in the last week? Two weeks? Do any of them have a weak immune system? Diabetes? Some kind of latent health condition that might make them at risk?

Seriously, it's gonna be a nightmare here on the West Coast where all the fatalities are happening until we get a handle on Corvid test production and really get going on screening everyone. 

On a more personal note, I hope they immediately start testing schools and colleges. I go to UC Davis and a lot of people here live in the surrounding area with family to save money. And a lot of the school population works (obviously). Since we're prime carrier age, they should test us first. Simultaneously, they should also begin to screen retirement homes and retirement neighborhoods. Offer to sell tests to doctors who primarily have older patients. Just produce tons of tests and don't fuck around. And if somebody wants to be tested that isn't in a retirement home or college? Make it available for purchase through a hospital or doctor. Medicare and other medical insurance companies should make it a test they cover the cost for.

Just don't fuck around."

First, given spotty reporting at this early stage of the game, there are many questions about the veracity of reported data from many countries. Therefore it is not possible to know with any certainty the precise US ranking.

We just aren't testing much, so there will of course be lower confirmed cases.

The amount of testing is also why our death rate will be higher. If we only tested post-mortem for coronavirus, our confirmed cases would have a 100% death rate. Doesnt mean 100% die, just 100% of those we bothered to test."

Singapore: 23 cases per million (current), 200 tests per million (18 Feb)

Malaysia: 2.6 cases per million (current), 63 tests per million (5 mar)

Thailand: 0.7 cases per million (current), I haven't been able to find test numbers, but 58 people per million have been or currently are quarantined in hospital, so take that as you may.

Vietnam: 0.2 cases per million (current), 18 tests per million (3 mar), also, about 5 times that number have been in quarantine/monitored.

Phillipines: 0.05 cases per million (current), 6 tests per million (basically current)

Indonesia has had very low testing numbers, to the point that the confirmed number of infected is likely wildly inaccurate, and their testing number is likely lower than the US per capita.

Since I didn't breach any fever or time thresholds, I didn't go into the doctor.  Was it COVID?  Probably not I guess, but who knows (several people in our office had similar stories).  


If I was to get similar symptoms now, I certainly would not go into the doctor, and my insurance it great, if there was a test it would be included in our plan.  No way am I going into the doctor unless I am having problems breathing - if I go in and don't have COVID I might catch it there.  If I go in prior to when I need to and I have COVID, I might spread it.  So, I think the fatality % of COVID is going to be hard to pin down.

Our policy on political posts is as follows:

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

It is in relation to the number of confirmed cases.

It's not fake news, but the number is naturally skewed due to lack of tests and the cluster of deaths at the nursing home.

We knew over a month ago that it was spreading in the wild in Canada.  
Their ... I have no non-vulgar words ... their glorious, great, amazing highly-competent, respectable, and very-thoughtful leader imposed no effective quarantine procedures so it started spreading in Toronto. Once that happened is was over. Containment was lost because Canada.  
  
Once you detect a death that means it's been spreading for four to six weeks.  
So we are now about eight to ten weeks into it spreading in Canada and are now five to seven weeks into it spreading in the US. It's already leaped from Toronto to London, ON. It's spreading in the wild in multiple cities in the US.

Containment was lost ***two months ago***.  
If the governor of your state has not started issuing orders for things like compulsory hand-washing before lunch at all K-12 schools and started getting the state prepared for a shutdown they are incompetent. Port-of-entry states like New York and California needed to impose heavy quarantine procedures in January. They didn't. Trump issued a travel-ban to and fro China and got shit for it - because never let a tragedy go to waste.  
  
Testing doesn't do fuck-all. You are infectious before symptoms show and there is no treatment.  
The only people that should bother to get tested now are doctors and nurses so they know *when* they contract it so they can stop seeing patients.  
The country's mindless obsession with useless medical procedures never ceases to astound me.  
I don't even understand how they make anyone feel less anxious unless you're *hoping* it comes up positive.  
  
If Trump had half the balls he thinks he does he would order a nation-wide 14-day shutdown tomorrow but that is completely pointless unless we get Mexico and Canada to do the same thing at the same time and end all travel to Europe.  
  
What happen was the bean counters added up the cost of shutting everything down and made a prediction of how many people are going to die and decided it was worth it to keep everything running."

The incubation period is so long, that the fellow who eventually developed symptoms had more than enough time to transmit it to others locally. I knew in January that it would eventually be detected amongst those who live here. As for the nursing home, it really isn't that mysterious.

Residents at the nursing home do venture out into the community, it isn't a prison. They also receive visitors. I'm guessing that someone at the nursing home caught it from someone in the community, where it had already spread, and just hadn't been reported yet. They took it back there, and it took hold with those residents most vulnerable to it, much like you will see during a regular flu season."

As of March 3rd, WHO is now saying the death rate is as high as 3.4%, making Covid19 34 times more deadly than the flu:

[https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020)

Flu: symptoms appear within 1 day of catching it. Corona Virus: Symptoms appear 1 to 14 days after catching it. That means you may spread it for a week or two before you even know you're sick.

Flu: survives on surfaces for 1 day. Corona virus: survives on surfaces for 9 days. That means if someone with the flu uses a gas pump, that pump is safe to use a day later. If someone with corona virus uses a pump, it's still infecting people more than a week later, meaning a single person has far more opportunities to infect others with corona virus than with the flu.

source for the 9 days claim: [https://www.ktvu.com/news/covid-19-more-contagious-than-sars-or-mers-can-live-on-surfaces-for-up-to-9-days-studies-say](https://www.ktvu.com/news/covid-19-more-contagious-than-sars-or-mers-can-live-on-surfaces-for-up-to-9-days-studies-say)

Flu: Has a vaccine. Corona virus: Doesn't. You can take preventative medical measures to protect yourself from flu exposure, but you can't with corona virus.

Flu: affects young and old similarly (though more deadly to infants and the elderly). Corona virus: does not appear to affect young people much at all (no one under 10 has died yet, most are asymptomatic), but is far deadlier to the elderly (20% mortality rate above age 80). This makes children a vector for transmission as they may have a little sniffle that wouldn't keep them home from school most of the time, but is deadly to older folks.

Source for Covid19 being more deadly for the elderly: [https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/03/the-coronavirus-is-deadly-for-older-people/](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2020/03/the-coronavirus-is-deadly-for-older-people/) (not a great source, just a quick one I found; this data is easy to find other sources for).

the thing is, this virus got 100k infested and about 3k died of it.

Now do the math. It's a coronavirus, like the flu (yes it is), the incubation time is about 14 days (a bit longer than the flu), there is no vaccine yet means it will spread and mutate.

How do you deal with it when it hits a million? 30k deaths. If it hits the number of 50 million in the US like the flu? 

There we go. It will hit at 2 percent (im going low here) 1(one) million deaths annualy.

They are absolutely killing it with their approach and we should all be taking notes. They definitely made some improvements after their MERS problems in 2015. If the US just keeps testing the people who wind up in critical condition or have close contact with people who have traveled, our denominator will continue to stay lower, we will miss lots of non- severe cases, those people will spread to others, and the critical cases are going make the numerator go up and the mortality rate will look way higher than other places.

Because this is what's happening, racism towards a country that is simply doing its job.

Italy is doing many more tests compared to any other european country.
This could mean that the numbers of people with coronavirus in other countries are massively underestimated.

The spread didn't start from italy, and italians don't have to take the blame for the spread of the virus.

OK, I didn't know the numbers but I figured they were both non-issues and never took them seriously when the media sensationalized it all. H1N1 was absolutely nothing. 61 million infected, 12,500 died. That's 0.02% dead from that. I don't know how many were actually infected by Ebola, but a similar number of around 11-12,000 died as well. Assuming the numbers were much lower than H1N1 then maybe it's not fair to lump a potentially way more fatal virus/illness with a sensationalized flu. 

We can try to hypothesize whatever we'd like, but going by the actual numbers...

I told him firstly the Coronavirus has only been around a few months, second of all the death rate of the flu is .1% vs around 3.4% for the coronavirus. So about 40x more deadly.  We're in the early stages and the coronavirus seems to be about as infectious if not a little more than the flu. So if the same number of people get the coronavirus that got the flu in 2018 we're looking at around 1.3 million deaths just in the US.

Edit: 3.4% based on the World Health Originization estimate. This is simply the number of people tested to number of dead,this isn't to be taken as an estimate of future mortality rates since mild cases are much less likely to be tested than severe cases resulting in a high percentage.

You'd think that immune systems work the same way in that if something compromises an old person's immune system there's always an equivalent rate for how it affects young people's immune systems. I don't understand how the ratio can change depending on the disease.

I'm not saying that COVID-19 is not worse than the flu. But, first off there is FAR more data to work with on the various different flu strains. COVID-19 has almost nothing in comparison. So far the mortality rate is comparable to the flu. If you're going to be spouting out numbers about something serious, then please provide sources to back up your claims. I.e. please stop the hyperbole."

The doctor said it was most likely the flu (which I believe to be true) since the flu was spreading like crazy around that time. They didn't even bother testing for the flu. They just prescribed me tamiflu and that was it. I had stable fever around 102F and cough for 5 days in a row. My sinuses also got infected. The cough lasted longer, probably 11 days or 12 days.

We live in Bergen County, NJ and my wife works in NYC. She was sick 2 weeks ago with a mild cold. No fever, slight cough, runny nose, a bit run down feeling, back on her toes in a couple days. Then both my son (who is asthmatic) and myself became sick over this past weekend. Both had slight fevers (running between 99-100 degrees), I had a slight cough, runny nose, my son developed a very strong cough. We brought him to the dr on Monday, was told it was just a cold, give him albuterol a few times a day through nebulizer and sent on our way. Literally, the day after we brought him to the doctor, we had our first confirmed case in Bergen County, NJ. As of yesterday, we now have 2 confirmed cases in Bergen County, NJ.

By your logic, then % is also no good in China either, which has been dealing with this since December. 

The fact is, it's relative and until the the virus is contained (globally) the denominator is a moving target.  Even the flu has a floating number that is also relative by season, multiple seasons etc.

>The concept “anti-American” is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships, something I wrote about many years ago (see my book Letters from Lexington). Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as “anti-Soviet.” That’s a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as “anti-Italian.” It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.

>More like between 1-1.5%. Please stop spreading misinformation

You're reading your own source incorrectly. using the top range numbers, 61,000 deaths out of 45,000,000 illnesses is approximately 0.1%. The bottom range numbers give a comparable average. If you intended to say covid19 was less dangerous, well, you shouldn't have linked to a page about the flu.

Please apologize for calling my numbers misinformation, and correct your post so as not to mislead anyone yourself.

>The mortality rate for COVID-19 is not certain yet.

This is true. All numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. The 2% was taken from the CDC several days ago. They recently released a new number saying it's a 3.4% mortality rate, which is even worse. I don't trust that number, however, because other nations have reported near 2%.

He also ate lunch in Bellevue. Right now he’s sick with a mild cold, but because of where he’s been I think he may have contracted COVID already. It’s very mild so nobody cares. He hasn’t been tested and we aren’t under a quarantine. 

I called the health department and told them that we had a suspected coronavirus case AND my husband works with an at-risk population. He’s in the military and is a medic, so he works all day with people who live in a dorm. I was on hold for an hour and then the call was dropped. I went over to the base emergency department and the nurse working there asked if we’d been to China. When I said no, she literally rolled her eyes at me. Said he was negative then, and to stop watching the news. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one with a similar story. I was an army medic too so I get it; you don’t have the resources to test every nervous military kid. But JBLM is an hour from Seattle and has a huge number of soldiers and airmen living in dormitories. When I was active I got a cold and developed pneumonia just from how closely and austerely we lived. JBLM should be testing, full stop, but they aren’t even advising families with potential cases to quarantine. So when a US solider inevitably contracts COVID and dies from complications, I hope everybody knows they could have prevented this and actively chose not to."

Chances are not high that anyone freaking out about this will actually die from it unless they're really old or have a compromised or just shittier immune system than they THINK they have. That's my gut feeling.

The unfortunate reality is that millions of elderly or already sick people will die due to the government's (potentially willful) incompetence which COULD bring it up to 1,500,000 deaths out of 35 million infected. But it would be made up mostly of the elderly or sick, not healthy or younger men and women.

95% of the confirmed media deaths have all been the elderly and you don't focus on the thousands of people who have had it and recovered, we tend to just focus on the minority of tragic deaths.

I wish this information was spread around more than it is, I live in Mexico where the president and the people helping him have not addressed this issue in depth, people are going outside with no precaution and no one is buying anything to protect themselves, and also for whatever reason there are no masks available or antibacterial products.

Our policy on political posts is as follows:

This sub could be entirely filled with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

The lack of universal healthcare means people only go to the doctor if they really need to.  
This will help quell panic and will help prevent our medical system from getting overwhelmed. It is not without consequences as sometimes people wait too long or avoid going when they should. This is why you get a PCP that you can contact and talk to and they can help you sort out if you should go to the hospital.  
  
It will keep people like thenationalblade, who doesn't seem to understand the difference between tests and treatments, from wasting medical-staff's time.  
  
But wait there's more. If you're a rich Republican then you can afford premium health-care. Maybe you even make regular large donations to the local hospital and they have a wing named after you. So if we're willing to be selfish, the lack of universal healthcare means I am more likely to be seen and treated when I need to go.  
  
What is actually going to be interesting to watch is how all, all, ALL, **ALL**, of the socialist medical systems melt-down once panic hits because there is absolutely no counter-pressure to keep people from stampeding to the hospital.  
And in the US, because there's money to be made, hospital wait times will **go down** as hospital organize and staff up to meet demand and rake in the ca$h."

The effects of any virus suck more for me, so my experience will be one of the more extreme. Keep in mind please I have not been and have no word on testing. I am on a list.

Symptoms started Dec 27th, with shortness of breath and the dry cough. The shortness of breath was very noticeable. I did not feel sick, just tired. A lot. Over the next few weeks just general symptoms. Headache here and there, hoarse through, dry cough, but the struggle to get air and extreme fatigue was constant. I knew something was off but never had a fever. Around the middle of February I started coughing up clear mucus with dark brown/blackish speckled spots. It started to hurt to breathe, as if the tissues were real tender. I never got a fever but at this point intense night sweats and chills/weakness started. Signs of infection my body is fighting. This picked up until I was sweating a lot and started having chest pains and constant high pulse (120-130bpm). Again, EDS, my tissues are weak. The more I coughed this stuff up the easier I could breathe, but it would sting to breathe for a bit. These symptoms have subsided little bits day by day as my body continues doing it's thing."

Furthermore, after speaking with the CDC, they denied testing because the pt didn’t have a fever lol... thats the only criteria she didn’t meet on the list, and they recommended she be discharged.

I guess the coronavirus wasn’t a natural outcome of caging multiple different species of wildlife on top of one another in cramped unhygienic conditions with blood, puss and feces all over the place...

No. It was most definitely a bioweapon that China created to ravage its own economy and throw the whole world into a standstill...

Lol... 🤦‍♂️

...but my bad, I was wrong in the 20, I wrote that post as I was walking and hopping between streetcars. I didn’t read my source correctly.

So proportionally, the flu fatality numbers work out to this.

0.027% of the American population died from influenza in 17/18

VS

0.0043% of Canadians.

You don’t think that’s a little bit of a shock? To be the most powerful economy in the world and have almost triple the mortality rate for the flu?

As for Canada’s population being so widely dispersed... majority of the population lives in urban areas, close to the border. Hell man, more than half of the country lives in Ontario and Quebec. 

Population density in our major cities and the vast suburban communities that surround them isn’t too much different than that of our American counterparts. 

A quick comparison of Chicago (a smaller city) to Toronto: 10,000 people per square mile for Chicago, and 4200 people per square kilometre for Toronto. So to adjust for measurement that puts Toronto at about 7000-7500 people per square mile. 

But hey, if the flu is any indicator... ya’ll are about to be in for one helluva ride with COVID-19...  😒"

I have two internet providers. I use a Bell cellular device for high speed (I commonly get 70 Mbps up/down) and I have crap DSL from TekSavvy. I usually get about 1.5 Mpbs down, shit for up.

Crap DSL is about $70 a month, unlimited. It works almost well enough for youtube/netflix/prime. It can be a little slow to start streaming, but it's ok.

I use the Bell account for work because I work remotely and it isn't uncommon to be in video meetings. I also have a VoIP desk phone and remote into servers and things. This is billed on a tiered system. I usually use 30-40 gb of data and this costs around $110-130 a month.

I also have 10gb download on my mobile phone plan (also through Bell) so I route things like my laptop through that until I use up 9gb.

I did have a satellite system for a month through Xplorenet. Download was pretty good but it was somewhat expensive overall. Much more than the Bell setup. The latency was pretty bad so there's a bit of a lag between requesting a site and receiving it. I didn't care for it.

It is a bit of an adjustment since my previous house had fiber and could easily hit 130 Mbps up/down for about $70 a month. But the extra internet service costs are no big deal considering I don't have a high mortgage any longer. I also go out at night and see all the stars, I have an acre of land, surrounded by trees and foxes dash across my front yard. The trade offs are worth it for me."

The flu has been around for a while. That means many studies and screenings have been done on those who have contracted influenza. Estimations can be accurately established of those who contract the virus versus those who pass from the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 has only been around for like four months. The numbers we know are from  the worse of the worse.

Here's NBC doing the same thing, stating that Iran had a 9 to 16%  death rate.  Much like the above AOL headline stating that the US has a 5% rate, at least AOL finishes the point that its because of a lack of testing.   I would even argue that the NBC headline is even more misleading because it click baits you to read the article to ascertain that, whereas at least the above mentioned AOL article states it right in the headline that our testing sucks.

&#x200B;

>But Iran's reported mortality rate — now just nine under percent — surpasses the rate for other countries by a wide margin. Earlier this week, it was 16 percent. China's reported mortality rate is currently at 3.5 percent. In South Korea, 13 patients have died out of 1,766 cases, for a reported mortality rate of slightly less than 1 percent. A U.S. soldier is among those infected in South Korea.

TLDR:  News organizations take advantage of small data sets to click bait people into reading their shit."

He use to, he hired the first woman, black woman and some other shit back in the 80s

He then went on to appoint the first black female marine general gay ambassador and etc.

If you're looking at the current numbers as they stand now and extrapolating that linearly into the future then you are not listening to experts opinion either, you're doing the very thing you're complaining about. Raw data is not an opinion, any projections *you* make from that data is *your opinion,* not an experts. If you look at ebola, h1n1, etc numbers early on and make a linear projection from that you'd end up with a MUCH worse outcome than what actually happened as well. 

What most experts are saying now is essentially that we *don't know*. There's not enough data to make accurate long term predictions. I very much support the science side of it, I support it so much that I'm not going to take a stance one way or the other because the science is not yet in.

I truly feel for them and the workers that will either be laid off or struggle financially due to SXSW being cancelled. 

That being said, the promoters have either been naive or just stubborn in their attitude about this. If even one case had been tied to the festival and an outbreak occurred in Austin, the city government and the organizers would have had a slew of lawsuits on their hands and their brand would have been irreparably damaged. Those lawsuits may have gone nowhere, but they'ed still have to pay their own lawyers to fight them off and in the court of public opinion they would have been screwed.

Instead of trying to double down by bringing in replacement headliners and insisting for the event to go on, they should have been giving local businesses a heads up and made plans to postpone, hopefully just delaying revenue. Now they're scrambling to figure out how what to do and they're pissed. 

It probably wouldn't have helped much, but it would have been better than the current situation."

Edit: slight rant incoming;

I'm still bewildered by the overall public response in the United States... Do we think that we are genetically different from the Chinese and we will have some magical immunity to stop this virus from spreading...err... virally ? 

Obviously we won't be able to tightly quarantine millions of people like China... but is the only alternative to this simply ""wash your hands"", keep granny inside, don't panic and definitely don't wear masks ? 

I don't feel panicked whatsoever, I feel a bit frustrated and embarrassed at our national avoidance of pragmatism. 

Why are we still trying to avoid canceling events if at all possible ? Why are people acting like it some kind of sign of defeat ?  

It should be looked at as completely the opposite.... preventatively canceling large gatherings is actual real effort at slowing the spread, it's the responsible thing to do. 

We are being incredibly arrogant, especially compared to the efforts that China and Japan etc have been making.   

Countries aren't hermetically sealed containers, if the population of the  United States does little to slow the spread, this makes it that much harder for every other country to do so well... 

Imagine you and everyone in your city has been quarantined for days, everyone in public is wearing is wearing masks and taking precautions..... then you turn on TV and see footage from the United States... crowds of unmasked people in a city as if they are living on a seperate planet.  

If helping to spread this virus was equivalent to pollution, right now America feels like it's running coal plants at full clip in every major city."

Luckily I’m pretty sure that’s mainly a Seattle campus problem, and I’m at a satellite campus so I refuse to worry too much about it. Honestly, the main thing I’m worried about is how we’re supposed to present our group projects, if I have one more interruption from the audience because someone doesn’t mute their mic while I’m presenting I might go crazy lol."

What I am stating is that claiming the CDC guidelines are 'the bare minimum' is wrong, the guidelines are a measured, research based response taking advice from experts in infection control.

My concern is that people are listening to news outlets and hearing reports that are scaring them into behaving emotionally and irrationally about the situation because the reader/listener/viewer does not have the expertise to understand the facts without context.

As an example, on your point about mortality rates:

Comparing the mortality rates of seasonal flu and Covid-19 is not a useful measure. Worldwide recording of data about flu mortality has been captured for decades and we can make a reasonably accurate assumption here, however Covid-19 has existed for a couple months and we know nearly nothing about it because it's still being researched.

In your own post you report that a 3.4% global mortality and 5% US mortality, I've not checked this data, but one reason this number is so different is because we don't have enough data right now to make any kind of accurate estimation.

What we do know is that some people get the virus and are asymptomatic, or have very mild symptoms that would not necessarily lead them to think they had Covid-19. These people therefore don't get tested, treated or recorded as having survived Covid-19, this inflates the mortality rate higher than the reality of the situation.

A solution to this would be to do a large scale study of a sample population of people, however this isn't possible now because the virus is currently still actively spreading and this is the first few months of the virus' life.

If it were to become another worldwide seasonal disease like flu then scientists could study a population of people over a period of a year and publish findings from that, but this hasn't happened yet so any mortality data is purely a snapshot of those who were tested for Covid-19 and then died.

From this same data you could without context and understanding claim that 5% of people are dying from the test in the US and that the test is more lethal in the US than the rest of the world, but thats obviously nonsense and not true.

Look, I am worried too. I am not an expert either. But I refuse to allow the media to terrify me, I know I need to trust my government (in the UK) and analyse what everyone is telling me.

I agree that 3,000 in 100,000 would be an awful death toll, but 200 in 100,000 is too and thats based on the flu figure you wrote, and we do not actually know if these figures are accurate yet.

Also for a bit of context: there are 10 gun related deaths a year for every 100,000 and 11 car related deaths a year for every 100,000."

There are two major problems to tackle, the first is extracting audio/visual information from the test machine without tripping the security software or alerting the proctor. The second is getting the correct answer info back to the test-taker without alerting the proctor or their software.

For extracting audio/visual information, it's preferable to avoid tampering with the software entirely, on the assumption that the security software can do a fairly deep system inspection. You might be able to get away with a kernel rootkit or hypervisor rootkit masking some software, but it's an unnecessary risk. The cheapest way to get A/V out of the test environment would be a well-positioned pinhole camera, and a cheap audio bug. The fanciest way to do it that I can think of would be a laser mic and a TEMPEST setup or optical eavesdropping.

Once you've got the A/V out to the assistant, you need to get the assistant's answer back to the test-taker. Since line of sight is fairly tightly policed, you need to either get the signal back in a non-visible manner, or signal from very close to the natural sight line for the monitor. On the non-visible side of things, you can buy cell phone buzzer motors for pennies. Sufficiently muffled, and run at a low intensity and frequency, it could be used for morse code or pre-arranged code sequences depending on the answer type.

For visible options, you need to work within the line of sight constraints, which means the signal has to be very near to the monitor. If the computer is privately-owned, well-executed bezel modifications to install a small LED or strip of LEDs resembling typical status feedback lights would provide a channel for simple morse or pre-arranged codes. For school-provided computers, a low-powered laser, such as a laser pointer, placed well outside the camera's field of view, projecting onto the wall just above the monitor bezel would provide a similar single bit data channel. Of course, for a fancier, easier to use approach one could use the same oblique projection method, but construct a laser projector to output a text line just above the monitor bezel.

No matter which approach is chosen, the extraction and injection components of the cheat would need their own wireless communication system, and likely power system as well, which imposes some restrictions on their minimum size, plausible location and disguises, and viable running time.

----

From a technical perspective, it's absolutely possible to defeat the safeguards in place. However, they succeed in making the necessary prep work and setup to bypass them at least as arduous as simply learning the material and taking the test honestly.

Though if I found out a student built a TEMPEST rig just to cheat on a computerized test, I'd probably consider passing them anyways."

But for other areas of study it would be basically impossible.  

For example, I’m a Political Science major and for most of my classes there’s no way they could do that. Last semester I took 5 classes, 2 of which did not have final exams.   

For the ones that did, there’s no way to make an international relations, first-level Spanish, or public policy final 10 times harder than in class or so hard that cheating can’t help. The finals already covered damn near everything we learned in class and they were easy enough.    

This semester I’m taking 6 classes, and again 2 don’t have final exams. I am taking Microeconomics and a Logic course which are more or less STEM classes and the only ones that could actually have horrific take home finals. But it would be pointless because it wouldn’t be like “solve the n body problem” or some crazy hard math shit. It would be “calculate the dead weight loss for the following 100 supply and demand curves” or “define this list of all 300 terms and concepts we learned in class” or “construct a truth table for this TFL argument which contains 10 variables” or “make proofs for the following 200 arguments”.   

Yeah, sure, that would be hard as fuck but cheating would still help tons and at some point it just becomes tedious shitty busy work. You’re not actually being tested and cheating hasn’t been deterred or rendered ineffective, you’re just being punished for no reason.   

And before you say I go to a shitty university with shitty professors, I go to the most prestigious university in my state, it is one of the very best for my major in the country, and the faculty here (especially in my college), are some of the most influential and well known experts in their fields. A number of my professors frequently travel the world to give talks and lectures and hold seminars and all that fancy academic shit.   

And we have a laundry list of famous and influential alums.   

Basically what I’m trying to say is... you’re just smug."

The thing is that anywhere the ship ends up going, is going to have some kind of impact, since I'm not thinking that there are any military ports/facilities left that can handle the numbers of personnel involved, which would reduce the NIMBY factor.  

Mare Island, Port Charles, Alameda, Treasure Island, none really look that good to me, unless an on-ship quarantine is planned.

Hunters Point Shipyard, looks pretty empty/unused, and looks to have space to support a large tent city if that's the approach taken for a off-ship quarantine.

In any case, hopefully the ship has implemented effective isolation/quarantine procedures, to hopefully have a lower infection rate than the Diamond Princess.  I also hope that the US does a far better job than Japan apparently did when the Grand Princess is eventually allowed to dock and hopefully start the process of getting those who are sick/infected proper care and treatment.  And to get those who are not sick/infected, tested, isolated/quarantined to get them cleared so that they can move on with their lives.

Just my thoughts and observations, and as a lay person, my thoughts may be totally wrong.  But as concerned as I am about COVID-19, that concern (fear) won't make me take us vs them type attitude, and say or suggest things that are good for me, but comes at a potentially high cost for others.  Keeping the ship out of port without sufficient support is simply wrong, empathy is something that all of us should be having/showing/using when looking at COVID-19 and pretty much everything else that goes on around the world.

That's my two cents.

Be strong and stay well!"

At the time of her boarding the cruise ship, the virus didn't have that much coverage in the media. This was in the middle of February and widespread panic hadn't started yet. It wasn't something that was in the back of my friend's mind. 

While some could say my friend should've done more research or realized the risks she was taking, I would say this is more a failure of national organizations such as WHO and the CDC, who did not take the actions necessary to swiftly educate the public about the virus and its danger. The fact that the WHO has not declared COVID-19 a pandemic yet is a crime.

Alan Smithee (also Allen Smithee) is an official pseudonym used by film directors who wish to disown a project. Coined in 1968 and used until it was formally discontinued in 2000, it was the sole pseudonym used by members of the Directors Guild of America (DGA) when a director, dissatisfied with the final product, proved to the satisfaction of a guild panel that they had not been able to exercise creative control over a film. The director was also required by guild rules not to discuss the circumstances leading to the movie or even to acknowledge being the project's director.

Last night I couldn’t sleep because I kept going through the scenario that I hope we avoid in my head.  We’re not going to avoid it without major travel restrictions and quarantines.  I’m a RN. 

From what I understand, we’re about a week or two away from what’s happening in italy.   We have about the same capacity in our medical system.  

If you consider that this virus has a much higher mortality rate than the flu, and that about 10-20% of people require hospitalization, you quickly realize that we do not have nearly enough hospital beds to help everyone.  

Let’s run some numbers.  

We have 2-3 hospital beds available for every 1000 people on average in the US.  If we have 1000 ppl who are positive for the virus (easily the case in Seattle) 100-200 ppl could require hospitalization.  Let’s say there are 10,000 hospital beds available for a city of about 3.5 million.  That’s a rough estimate. 

Only a very small percentage of these rooms are the kind of negative pressure rooms that we require to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the hospital.  Some hospitals only have 2-3 some have 10 — for the entire hospital.  Hundreds of people requiring hospitalization at the same time would undoubtedly overload the system.  So the hospitals have very low capacity to handle this virus because patients often end up needing very specialized rooms.  It seems like they are at a threshold now, where unless they contain it like yesterday, they will end up in a situation where there are no beds left for anyone.  

Let’s say 1000 ppl are infected now (likely an underestimate) we can expect 100-200 hospitalizations...and the caseload seems to double every 1-3 days.  So by Monday they could need 200-400 additional hospital beds.  And it gets worse because those first 100-200 patients who were hospitalized didn’t just get up and walk out of the icu after being on a ventilator.  You have to account for the fact that you already have 100 people hospitalized who won’t vacate those beds for a while.  So on Monday maybe they need 300-600 beds available.  And they need the staff to care for these people, and they need testing available for the staff and the protective equipment and you can see how this snowballs into a completely horrifying disaster.  

If we don’t stop it from spreading, how many days until we overload the hospital system?  

It’s not going to take very long.  Especially with the outbreaks occurring in nursing homes where infection prevention is basically impossible."

Most people can visualize linear growth but not exponential growth. 

For example: 

Let’s say you have a jar with two bacteria. The bacteria population doubles every minute and it will take exactly 24 hours to fill the jar... 

About 90% of the jar will suddenly fill up in the last few minutes. 

After 23 hours and 55 minutes have passed, the jar will still only be 1/16 full which still seems pretty empty. 

But as that doubles again and again over the next 5 minutes the jar will be COMPLETELY full. 

In the last minute, the jar will go from being 1/2 full to completely full... So as much growth happens in the last minute as the previous 23 hours and 59 minutes combined. 

Currently the number of cases outside of China is tripling every week. 

Cities are expected to go through this type of growth where all of a sudden tens of thousands of people get really sick all at once and it totally overwhelms the hospitals. 

This is what happened in Wuhan. It’s expected to happen in other cities once the virus reaches a critical mass in those communities. 

Even if it’s no more deadly than the flu, it will still cause a massive disruption if 15% of a large population center with millions of people suddenly get pneumonia all at once. 

The % of the population who die from this is currently about 2% but it goes WAY up if the hospitals are swamped and the old folks with pneumonia can’t receive treatment."

It spreads much more easily, nobody will have natural resistance to it (that we know of), there is no vaccine, mortality (death) rate is anywhere from 10 to 50 times greater, hospitalization rate is much higher (~20% of those infected), people can have it for 2 or more weeks and show no symptoms while spreading it. 

Everyone needs to act like it could be anywhere and if you have a persistent cough, especially with a fever, avoid being around other people as much as possible, wear some sort of mask whenever in public (but avoid going in public as much as you can). Wash your hands as much as possible, use hand sanitizer or some other means of disinfecting your hands when you can't. Avoid large crowds and standing / walking close to people. If anyone coughs where you are, stay far from them and do not walk in the area they coughed for a few minutes as contaminated droplets could be lingering in the air. Anything you buy at a store could be contaminated so clean/disinfect stuff you bring in. Your shoes may be contaminated so disinfect the soles before walking in your home / apartment or take them off at the entrance.

He also points out if you're in a lower risk group, you should not selfishly think you're fine and do things that could infect others. You're still at higher risk than with the flu but more importantly, your carelessness around a high risk person could lead to their death. I think this also applies to joking around about it (""let me impress my buddies / Youtube fans by fake coughing onto people lol"") or trying to prove you're a tough guy or how much of an asshole you are by coughing into the open air at or around others. The former is just a shitty thing to do right now but you could actually have it and be spreading it, not aware that you do have it (up to 2 weeks of no symptoms), the latter being a common issue in NYC at least."

The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.

1) Fatality rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential. 

2) Influenza is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no official treatment, it's done case-by-case. 

As a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating."

Anyone who says it's nothing, just another flu, or something similar is undoubtedly a moron. At the same time, it's not as bad as a lot of people (especially online) are suggesting. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. A lot of it is somewhat sensationalised by the media to sell, but people should also be incredibly aware and more steps should be taken to slow spread. In the UK we have done a decent amount of testing, but the only action taken has been being told to wash our hands. To the contrary, workplaces and universities have been advised to stay open. I think we've already missed our best shot at slowing spread but I'm baffled why no universities have been closed yet. Everyone knows disease like mumps, flu, etc spread insanely fast in them. Do they think COVID-19 won't?

The real concern I think is how poorly most governments worldwide have handled it, if it isn't used as a learning experience when the actual doomsday virus comes around we will be screwed. People should be less afraid of 'extreme' methods like the ones China used in quarantining."

>The plague killed a greater proportion of the world’s population at that time, but it took nearly a century to kill the same number as the 1918 flu did in about 15 months.

Case-fatality rate is not as big of a problem as spread rate. It doesn't matter if 90% of patients die from a virus if it only spreads to one other person at a time, or has an inefficient method of spread.

On the other hand if you have a 2% fatality rate and the virus can spread world-wide, it's impossible to contain and therefore is likely to result in more deaths overall.

There's a difference between a respirator and a mask, which is where the confusion is coming from. N95 ""masks"" are respirators with filters. Surgical masks don't work at filtering, they act as a barrier.

>The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like Ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.  
>  
>1) Fatality  rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds  counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were  actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading  to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to  be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with  contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than  someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a  more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it  infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that  it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential.  
>  
>2) Influenza  is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats  touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses  themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so  fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality  rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but  either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't  have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no  official treatment, it's done case-by-case.  
>  
>As  a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible  vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not  as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread  (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating."

Please look to find those responses. Essentially Ebola is so fatal that the potential for wide area spread is significantly lower. People die from Ebola so fast that the contamination comes either through fecal matter or through proximity to the body/incapacitated individual.

In contrast to this, COVID-19 spreads more similarly to influenza, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. Given the existing statistics for the number of people that die from influenza each year (with anti-virals and a vaccine), the fear comes from the potential number of deaths that will come from this virus given how much more fatal it is than influenza.

No one other than me seems to care at all about this, These scientifically literate people just dismiss what is happening as not much worse than the flu. Rather than take precautions or change their lives just a bit in response to the situation, they just ignore it.

Our policy on political posts is as follows:

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

Any school closures have so far been made by those individual schools despite government advice to remain open. I assume there's testing on people incoming from hotpots (or at least ""recommended"" self-isolation?), but again - we know there's communal spread and (correct me if I'm wrong) but literally nothing has been done about it.

It's great for the PM and Chief Medical Officer constantly saying we've got a contain phase and a delay phase, but what exactly have we done in those phases to warrant those names?

Expanding the NHS capacity is obviously amazingly important. But even then we're not going to be able to hospitalise everyone who needs it, especially not all those who need intensive care. I was under the impression that's why these first two phases were so important. Contain and delay to spread out the load on the NHS and at least try and stop our health system from becoming crippled.

But so far, no school or university closures, not even an official recommendation to work from home where possible. Everyone, employers and schools, are waiting on some action to fall in line behind. But there's nothing. Official line is literally (quote) ""business as usual"" with the PM also publicly mulling over the idea of (quote) ""One of the theories is perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures.""

Again, it's great talking up a contain and delay plan, but only if you actually enact it and don't directly contradict it in public."

Not even the Spanish Flu infected that high a percentage of the world's population at the time. It only got to 27% in two years.

Obviously there are issues with this comparison as there are many factors that increased the fatality of the virus at that time (World War 1).

Realistically I would say that the best way to view it would be between the figures of Spanish Flu and current Influenza. Given how it spreads in a similar way to Influenza, I think the comparison is fair as long as the differences in fatality rate and symptoms are considered. The main thing is that a lot more people are able to be infected by COVID-19 than they are by influenza, and herd immunity plays a large part in that.

What this doesn't account for are differences in the way viruses are transmitted generally. COVID-19 acts more like Influenza in the way it is spread.

>To infect a cell, coronaviruses use a ‘spike’ protein that binds to  the cell membrane, a process that's activated by specific cell enzymes.  Genomic analyses of the new coronavirus have revealed that its spike  protein differs from those of close relatives, and suggest that the  protein has a site on it which is activated by a host-cell enzyme called furin.  
>  
>This is significant because furin is found in lots of  human tissues, including the lungs, liver and small intestines, which  means that the virus has the potential to attack multiple organs, says  Li Hua, a structural biologist at Huazhong University of Science and  Technology in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. The finding could  explain some of the symptoms observed in people with the coronavirus,  such as liver failure, says Li, who co-authored a genetic analysis of  the virus that was posted on the ChinaXiv preprint server on 23 February. SARS and other coronaviruses in the same genus as the new virus don't have furin activation sites, he says.  
>  
>The furin activation site “sets the virus up very differently to SARS in  terms of its entry into cells, and possibly affects virus stability and  hence transmission”, says Gary Whittaker, a virologist at Cornell  University in Ithaca, New York. His team published another structural  analysis of the coronavirus’s spike protein on bioRxiv on 18 February.  
>  
>Several other groups have also identified [the activation site](http://virological.org/t/the-proximal-origin-of-sars-cov-2/398) as possibly enabling the virus to spread efficiently between humans. They note that these sites are also found in other viruses that spread  easily between people, including severe strains of the influenza virus.  On these viruses, the activation site is found on a protein called  haemagglutinin, not on the spike protein.

>The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than some other recent viruses like Ebola and technically the flu *has* killed more people. The problem is that these arguments do not take into account two main factors.  
>  
>1) Fatality rate does not mean more people will die from it: This sounds  counter-intuitive but consider it this way. With Ebola, people were  actually dying so quickly from infections that they were not spreading  to as many people. The more fatal the virus the less likely they tend to  be to spread for reasons like this. It's much easier to deal with  contamination/spreading from someone either dead or incapacitated than  someone capable of moving around freely. In comparison, COVID-19 has a  more reasonable fatality/mortality rate, so it doesn't kill everyone it  infects. This is actually not necessarily a good thing in the sense that  it means more people can be infected, as spread is exponential.  
>  
>2) Influenza  is statistically less fatal, it's just more wide-spread: The stats  touted about deaths from Influenza are not representative of the viruses  themselves. Influenza has both a vaccine and antiviral treatment, so  fatality rate is much lower than COVID-19 at 0.1%. The current fatality  rate for COVID-19 is said to be 3.4% (this is likely to be inflated, but  either way it will be higher than influenza). Equally, COVID-19 doesn't  have a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. If you're infected there is no  official treatment, it's done case-by-case.  
>  
>As  a result many health officials/professionals are able to understand  that if you project forward in time from now, using current growth  statistics (alongside how long we have to wait until any possible  vaccine will be available) it's easy to see that while COVID-19 is not  as widespread as influenza currently, if it does become as widespread  (experts predict 30-80% infection worldwide) it will be devastating."

This “outbreak” is clearly the most frightening novel virus outbreak _which has occurred_ in a long time.

No virologist would suggest it’s the most frightening _we know of_ or that’s it’s the most frightening potential zoonotic spillover.

What I’m saying is that all the people I know have been anticipating this and expected it to be a more dangerous virus when it did.

It’s not the opposite, it’s two complimentary points on the same issue."

Like, you learn about the characteristics, and then realise that while usually, fatal diseases have short incubation times, clear symptoms and kill you fast while not being very infectious, they don't have to be, and yet our hope for containment depends on it. Imagine HIV spread via sneezing. Or Ebola had an asymptomatic, infectious period for 6 months prior to bleeding everywhere and dying. I thought my teacher would tell me this is impossible. He didn't.

In the virus I proposed, everyone on Earth would get infected during an mildly symptomatic, infectious stage, before the first death occurred. At which point everyone would be positive, the disease would still be utterly unknown and unresearched, as all those spreading it mistook it for a common cold, and people would drop dead roughly in the order they were infected by, spaced only days apart.

It seemed like a game at the time."

At the moment there is also guidance to self-isolate if you have travelled from certain areas, and messaging on hand washing. There's been very little communal spread to actually try to delay so far.

If you implement extreme measures too soon, people will think you are over-reacting and stop following future advice. 

You also can't keep extreme measures up for too long due to the cost (both social and economic), and implementing them disrupts other important things - for instance, if you shut schools, you lose lots of nurses who have to stay home to look after their kids."

Swear to god it's like being Biff and having a copy of the Sports Almanac.

Every step of the way we are repeating history.

The hemorrhagic features are described in detail in the book. Bleeding out the ears, nose, eyes, rectum were common.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/)

*Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, or typhoid. One observer wrote, “One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred” (*[*Ireland, 1928*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 57). A German investigator recorded “hemorrhages occurring in different parts of the interior of the eye” with great frequency (*[*Thomson and Thomson, 1934b*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*). An American pathologist noted: “Fifty cases of subconjunctival hemorrhage were counted. Twelve had a true hemotypsis, bright red blood with no admixture of mucus…. Three cases had intestinal hemorrhage” (*[*Ireland, 1928*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 13). The New York City Health Department's chief pathologist said, “Cases with intense pain look and act like cases of dengue … hemorrhage from nose or bronchi … paresis or paralysis of either cerebral or spinal origin … impairment of motion may be severe or mild, permanent or temporary … physical and mental depression. Intense and protracted prostration led to hysteria, melancholia, and insanity with suicidal intent” (*[*Jordon, 1927*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22148/#)*: 265).*"

>Experiments in manipulating viral genomes are ""now routine,"" writes Mae-Wan Ho. ""It shows how easy it is to create new viruses that jump host species in the laboratory, in the course of apparently legitimate experiments in genetic engineering. Similar experiments could be happening in nature when no one is looking, as the SARS and many other epidemics amply demonstrate.""

>In other words, continues Mae-Wan Ho, ""geneticists can now greatly speed up evolution in the laboratory to create viruses and bacteria that have never existed in all the billions of years of evolution on earth.""

Also relevant parts from her [HuffPost interview](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6944450):
>Suzan Mazur: How does the current attention to viruses and viroids throw a further wrench into the Modern Synthesis?

>Mae-Wan Ho: A long time ago Howard Temin already proposed that the viruses -- our genomes are full of viruses -- so there's a theory that they are remnants of past infections, etc. The other theory that Howard Temin has is -- well maybe they actually had functions in cells. And maybe viruses were like the transposons that escaped.

>Mae-Wan Ho: I’ve written a paper called “[The New Genetics and Natural versus Artificial Genetic Modification](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/11/4748).” The thing is, if you look at an ordinary organism, our cells actually make their genome quite stable and they divide or not, as needed. They don’t actually multiply out of control. 

>So cancer is a disease of communication. When the organism loses its coherence, then you get cancer. [Harry Rubin's work](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/02/07/virus-expert-and-cancer-biologist-harry-rubin-dies-at-93/) on this is especially interesting. He discovered that if you take the cells out of the body and grow them in culture, then they mutate all over the place. Their genomes are not stable. You need a holistic integrity to keep genomes stable. Otherwise, they aren’t.

>For instance, if you take stem cells or cells in culture — you’re very careful to clone them, etc. — but as soon as you put them in culture you get chromosomal abnormalities, mutants."

""The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and **the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6.** We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective  ""

A ""mild"" case, of which around 70-80% of people are said to get from this (not a figure I've pulled out of nowhere, this is what others are estimating) is in reference to people who did not require oxygen. This meant that many ""mild"" cases were still hospitalised and potentially experiencing pneumonia.

Equally the belief that this is a ""tip of the iceberg"" situation is currently being debated. As is stated in this video Bruce Aylward (again, of the WHO) believes it to be a ""pyramid"" where mortality rate would be higher than 1%.

Evidence from Chinese and U.S. samples](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208541):

*Collectivistics* have been assumed to *possess more self-control than individualistics*, which was supported when self-control was measured *by behavioral but not by attitudinal measure*. One plausible reason may be because although Easterners make favorable self-evaluations, it is not as prevalent and explicit as U.S. individuals. In the current study, U.S. participants might rate themselves to have higher self-control to give others a good impression, but this self-enhancement strategy is not usually used in Chinese context. However, Chinese participants indeed showed higher behavioral self-control than U.S. counterparts. This may reflect *Chinese participants’ long-term exercise of inhibition / suppression ability*.

Moreover, no interaction effect between country and individual-level individualism and collectivism was found, in consistent with recent research which discloses that *family allocentrism, one’s allocentric orientation towards family, was related to better (attitudinal) self-control in both Chinese and Italian adolescents with equal magnitude*. Taken together, the long-held assumption that *“collectivistics have more self-control than individualistics” seems to enjoy more consistent support when individual-level individualism-collectivism framework is used.*"

Our policy on political posts is as follows:

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."

When in trade school I was given a print out of money owned(missed time had to be paid for and required by law to be made up) and just started backwards running the different numbers on the page basically checking the math and found an error. Thing is I didn't actually realize I was doing the numbers it was just fun brain food to see how seeming unrelated numbers in this unorganised Excel spreadsheet  along with a time log worked together for all the different amounts. I had zero reason to doubt the numbers but I did for fun and not consciously. And I do it all the time. I hate the sometimes awful conclusions I realize. Sometimes it's good but it can be a bit of a soul searching exercise too. Such as knowing that if that error had been in my favor would I have said anything. No one will ever know for sure not even myself but I know what I think I will do.


 Oh and reading the news and seeing how different seemingly unrelated things are actually connected once you see all the data. I check the markets and lows like brexit (was a pretty bad day for stocks across a lot of different sectors)  I buy then sell on the bounce. I hate that I even think of stuff like that but it's very hard to turn off. And where your morals lie."

If we had some kind of idea of how many people had it, how many serious cases we have, and how many deaths we have, *most* people would take more precautions just from self-preservation.

You would still have people who don't care, but I think we could put a dent in it.

But without that information, we are just putting on temporary blinders.  if 15 percent of cases require hospitalization, and only 60% of the population is infected, that's 31.5mil in the hospital... in a few months' time. and maybe 5 million dead.

no matter what the lack of testing, those numbers will not be hidden.  the economic hit is coming one way or another, and we might as well try to take it earlier and have it be less severe than later and more severe.

The assumption is that the virus is containable at some level. I'm of the opinion, and I *think* the Feds are too, that this is a fantasy. I think it's damn near everywhere. Maybe as high as half of the population or more already having it in some fashion, nationally and globally.

The only way you'd be able to tell is to test everyone, which, if true, would cause mass panic on top of being super expensive and a logistical nightmare.

 Assume it's false and you can somehow shut things down, you cause mass economic damage, with no guarantee of not having the spread anyways. It's a rock and a hard place."

* Novel coronavirus
* Begins slowly, relatively mild symptoms, countries believe they can contain it but ultimately fail
* No herd immunity
* No vaccine
* Promising antiviral treatments that ultimately fail
* (All of this is exactly what we are experiencing now with SARS-CoV-2)

*Outcome of simulation:*

>**The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed.

Lives could be lost and irrevocably changed on a scale we haven't seen in a long time, and that has long term economic impacts that will linger long after the actual pandemic ends. That will have its own cost.

If we instead doing everything possible to blunt the spread now, that's more time for our economic, health and social systems to react, which will reduce the long term impacts. Also, with test-confirmed cases outside of China doubling every three days, that's a recipe for millions of people being sick all at once within a month and that will also hurt economies. If we can draw that spread out longer, it means fewer simultaneous illness and more time to develop treatment strategies and to learn more about the disease.

I think in a week, maybe two, you'll see cases balloon in other populated places like the US and India. With it spreading uncontained, its only a matter of time now.

Testing, remember, is mostly useful to slow the spread when you can trace contact and quarantine exposed individuals, that only works when there is a relatively limited number of cases. I think we're past that at this point, and should be looking at broader measures like limitations on large public gatherings and strategies to encourage those who are sick to stay home - a tough sell when millions of people are a single missed paycheck from insolvency.

As I mentioned, the bigger issue in my eyes is even with extraordinary measures, China's healthcare system was hit pretty hard, I don't think our systems are prepared for a similar spike in demand, especially if we aren't doing everything possible now to slow the spread."

Which means that it currently spreads significantly faster (2<<r0<3) than the flu (1<r0<2), but if it were to stay with us for years (for both the flu- and corona-viruses immunity wanes, after a few years you can catch the same bug again) it might drop to a similarly low r0, because of immunity effects.

Attack rate is another interesting characteristic. Currently, if you spend 5-15 minutes sitting next to or across an infected person... chance of infection is 5-15%. Obviously higher for close contacts (family, caregivers) or longer contacts (sharing an office)."

I don't know if I agree with this after two facilities in my state went on a no visitors lock down. 

Staff is still a big variable here. They can't force the staff to live in the facility and outside ancillary staff have to be able to come in and out from time to time. During the years I worked as a CNA we were so chronically short staffed you had to be death bed sick in order to not get a strike on your record for calling in because it meant your coworkers would be pulling 12-16hr shifts instead of 10s to cover you.

It's better than doing nothing, absolutely. But I'm not convinced it's all that effective of a solution. This country has got to get the testing under control pronto."

Corvid-19 passes through the air as droplets and Coronaviruses can stay alive on objects like toilets, doorknobs and everything for up to 9 days.

Corvid-19 is far more contagious that the flu. Also Corvid-19 is contagious when asymptomatic (no symptoms) for days and up to 14 days average. There have also been cases of people showing no symptoms for as long as 24 days. There are literally infected people walking around shedding the virus and they have no idea. 

What is wrong with all these dumb government officials downplaying the danger of this disease. No one is even talking about the two separate strains of Corvid-19: L and S, one is more deadly than the other. Both strains have been found in the USA mainland.

Unfortunately, not so much. The thing about the R0 of the flu was from a Reddit comment. Of course, if you look at the chart of flu cases during flu season and after, it’s very obvious that the R0 is very different in winter and in summer, and that it’s obviously not just 1.3 in winter. I spent a significant time trying to find confirmation, but couldn't come up with anything.

As for the secondary attack rate, I heard that in a podcast. Upon looking it up, I got this result:

> H1N1 appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza. The secondary attack rate of seasonal influenza ranges from 5% to 15%. Current estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22% to 33%.

https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/assess/disease_swineflu_assess_20090511/en/

As for Covid-10, you get anything from 2% to 15%. I heard a German epidemiologist say that if he had to pull a number out of his ass (well he didn’t actually put it that way) it’d be 10-15% based on the various data.

A lot depends on sources. For example, I noticed the two studies you linked in support of secondary attack rate are pre-print and early release. That's not to dismiss their findings, but more to say we should wait until they've been reviewed and published, particularly since the Lancet published a secondary attack rate for SARS-COV2 of 35%. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30462-1/fulltext

*As for r0, the WHO compares COVID-19 to infuenza in its latest situation report. It states 
>The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is
understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza.
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2

It does go on to clarify
>estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult

so perhaps we're both partially correct on this one.

We don’t know Jack shit about this.   The tests give false negatives and positives all the time.  And there is not, to my knowledge, a reliable test for antibodies.  

I am....concerned....that administrators are making conflicting decisions throughout the world about what the protocols for dealing with this virus are.   Masks are not useful.  Masks are very useful.  No need for a mask.  You need a mask before you come to the ER.   Most people will be fine.  18% of people are seriously ill and 6-7% need ICU   This is just like the flu.  This is 20x worse than the flu.  You’ll be fine, don’t panic.   You need to prepare for quarantine.  Most people will go to work.  You need to stay home.  We have the best medical system in the world.  We only have RICU ventilators for around 10% more adults because of flu season so good luck if you need oxygen.  

WTF!!!!!   

We need a single clear policy, worldwide.   If country A applies it but country B ignores it, then Country A gets it again.   If you follow basic social distancing protocols but your neighbor is out at a concert - then what’s the point of your compliant effort?  You would have to hunker down in quarantine for the next 18 months.  And if you’re 55 or older - that’s likely the safest thing to do because COVID19 is a Boomer Doomer.  

Kept my son home from pre-K yesterday because the douche bags at the school think it’s ok for him to get packed on a bus, go visit a university with 5 other schools and listen to a concert.   Meanwhile Positive COVID cases in metro area are being announced.  Next week is grandparents day!   Great!   Let’s put the most vulnerable population in the same room as the most non compliant hand washers and most active vectors.  

And this horse shit that the kids will be fine.  Great.  One big less thing to worry about.    But my little rug rats are the dirtiest germ rags around and act as the vector to give me and their grandma the virus.   So yeah...let’s keep in school.  Cause they never spit or sneeze on adults.  Ever.   How can people be this stupid????    Lock down the schools now.   Limit the schools from mixing.  No more games.  No more sporting events.  Pare it down to essential gatherings only.   

I am BEWILDERED at the lack of even modest efforts to immediately implement basic social distancing throughout the country NOW.  TODAY.  It costs NOTHING to not have grandparents day or cancel a field trip.   Just fucking cancel that shit now.  

Whoever the fuck is in charge needs to go on national TV and just declare it - here are the new social distancing rules.....   no need to close things down but stop mixing groups without an urgent reason to, and STOP with the hand shakes.  OY!   WTF.  Stop touching your face.   Wear a mark.  Any mask is better than no mask (actually on the CDC website as an older advisory).   Jesus!   

This is what happened in 1918.   And those counties and cities that clamped down early simply died less.   It’s MATH."

https://www.jimmunol.org/content/194/1_Supplement/148.8.short

Abstract
Age-associated changes have long been known to cause dysregulation in antiviral immune responses. The SARS epidemic of 2002-03 was characteristic in this respect that it exhibited an age-associated increase in mortality. **We recently reported that an age-related increase in an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) contributed to the observed higher mortality in SARS-CoV infected aged compared to young mice.** To examine the factors that resulted in elevated levels of PGD2 in aged mouse lungs, we analyzed the gene expression levels of several enzymes in the eicosanoid pathway. **Remarkably, secretory phospholipase A2 group 2D (Pla2g2d), which is preferentially expressed in lung CD11c+ cells, was significantly higher in aged compared to young mice.** Lipid profiling of aged and young SARS-CoV-infected mice revealed that unlike young mice, **aged mice failed to upregulate many pro-inflammatory lipid mediators** although both groups upregulated the pro-resolving ones. Further, aged mice lacking PLA2G2D expression (Pla2g2d-/-) mice exhibited enhanced virus clearance, increased lung DC migration to the draining lymph nodes and increased virus specific T cell responses. Infection of aged Pla2g2d-/- mice with SARS-CoV increased survival from 20% to 80-90%, compared to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. **Altogether our data identify a novel role for Pla2g2d in the lungs of aged mice in skewing the lipidome to an anti-inflammatory state and thus predisposing the animal to a worse outcome following SARS-CoV infection.**"

Adults and older generations already have footprints of medications acting on virus and this become like embedded in the memory of our immune system. As this virus which have similarity in structure with other virus which we have vaccine and drugs to counter, our immune system will continually use the process that it learned with vaccines and drugs to fight it. Babies and toddlers have still this untainted immune system which doesn’t learned from external chemicals/factors. This immune system which are primitive in nature will 100% tackle and mutate to disable this virus. This would in turn be the first memory registered to the immune system which would possibly make this kids immune to this virus naturally. This is just my opinion and I’m nowhere near any scientific evidence so take this with a grain of salt."

When a dropplet of saliva or mucus enters the nose and reaches the olfatory nerves  it binds to neurons making its way towards the brainstem, especialy the area in charge of spontaneous breathing. 

This could explain why the person can be infected and not showing any signs until it reaches the brainstem.

This is the infection mechanism that might be the cause of most critical cases. Another infection mechanism is when it binds to the upper respiratory airways cells, reacting in a pattern similar to colds, and the flu.

When you are young probably the nervous system is still able to afford some dead neurons and destroys the infected, but as you get older the nervous system does not kill the infected neural cells and allows them to contaminate and propagate until it reaches the cns (central nervous system). 

At that point you have a 50% chance of losing your ability to breathe automaticaly; in other words you can only breathe consciously, so if you fall sleep or forget to exhale/inhale you wont breathe. Eventually not enough oxygen will go to the brain. Conciouness will be lost and so your breathing. You will need respiratory assistance.

Keep your nervous system healthy. Do not touch your mouth, eyes, nose and ears. Clean your god damn hands like your life depended on it, literally. Avoid congested places, improperly ventilated areas, and sick people. Block dropplets from entering the respiratory system. Block it with anything, a bandana, a scarf, a shirt, masks help too, however please leave n95 mask to doctors they need them the most. 

Keep yourself healthy, viruses like herpes, polio, influenza and rabies act in a very similar ways and some of then never leave the brain. Nobody knows if a cure will be found, and how long it could take. This S...t is getting out of hands.

**Age-related dysregulation in the lipidome compromises the immune response to the severe acute respiratory coronavirus (VIR5P.1140)**

Abstract Age-associated changes have long been known to cause dysregulation in antiviral immune responses. The SARS epidemic of 2002-03 was characteristic in this respect that it exhibited an age-associated increase in mortality. We recently reported that an age-related increase in an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) contributed to the observed higher mortality in SARS-CoV infected aged compared to young mice. To examine the factors that resulted in elevated levels of PGD2 in aged mouse lungs, we analyzed the gene expression levels of several enzymes in the eicosanoid pathway. **Remarkably, secretory phospholipase A2 group 2D (Pla2g2d), which is preferentially expressed in lung CD11c+ cells, was significantly higher in aged compared to young mice.** Lipid profiling of aged and young SARS-CoV-infected mice revealed that **unlike young mice, aged mice failed to upregulate many pro-inflammatory lipid mediators** although both groups upregulated the pro-resolving ones. Further, aged mice lacking PLA2G2D expression (Pla2g2d-/-) mice exhibited enhanced virus clearance, increased lung DC migration to the draining lymph nodes and increased virus specific T cell responses. Infection of aged Pla2g2d-/- mice with SARS-CoV increased survival from 20% to 80-90%, compared to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. **Altogether our data identify a novel role for Pla2g2d in the lungs of aged mice in skewing the lipidome to an anti-inflammatory state and thus predisposing the animal to a worse outcome following SARS-CoV infection.**"

It’s the first 12 weeks or so during which a baby’s immune system isn’t yet developed completely. They have some protection via maternal antibodies and from any antibodies they get via breast milk, but they’re still pretty vulnerable during that period. 

By about 3 months a baby’s immune system is considered mature and risks are reduced. But kids aren’t fully vaccinated until about 18-24 months and rely on herd immunity before that point for certain vaccine-preventable diseases. 

The bigger risk in a baby under 12 weeks of age is that they are just so small and can go downhill really fast from dehydration and breathing issues. If a baby can’t breathe well, they can’t eat, and eating (whether from breast or bottle) is nutrition and hydration. Even a simple cold in a baby under 12 weeks is scary."

"" experts theorize that whether a coronavirus infection takes a turn for the worse depends on a person’s immune response. “The virus matters, but the host response matters at least as much, and probably more,” says Stanley Perlman, a virologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa.

Once SARS-CoV-2 gets inside the human respiratory tract, it’s thought to infect and multiply in cells lining the airway, causing damage that kicks the immune system into action. In most people, it should trigger a wave of local inflammation, recruiting immune cells in the vicinity to eradicate the pathogen. The immune response then recedes, and patients recover. 

For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, some people—especially the elderly and sick—may have dysfunctional immune system response that fail to keep the response to particular pathogens in check. This could cause an uncontrolled immune response, triggering an overproduction of immune cells and their signaling molecules and leading to a cytokine storm often associated with a flood of immune cells into the lung. “That’s when you end up with a lot of these really severe inflammatory disease conditions like pneumonia, shortness of breath, inflammation of the airway, and so forth,” says Rasmussen. 

Local inflammation can turn into widespread inflammation of the lungs, which then has ripple effects across all organs of the body. This could also happen if the virus replicates faster than the immune system can respond, so that it then has to play catch-up to contain the pathogen—a situation that could also cause the immune defense to spiral out of control."""

False.

They don't have much in the way of immune system memory.

They have far greater adaptation than any other age group. The key to them obliterating corona is that the human thymus gland is most active in fetal and neo-natal life. Their bodies don't need to know what coronavirus is, they're just hilariously effective at annihilating new pathogens."

This suggests that the typical ""immune boosters"" could have a protective effect when taken under very specific circumstances. Getting enough sleep is also a known factor that significantly affects T-cell levels.

This case was particularly of interest because back in that time, youtube and reddit was full of ""mountains of dead in Wuhan"" and ""3 dead children in one body bag"" kind of information. The baby most likely got it from his/her mother and is part of a family cluster of infection (mother, father, baby. live-in domestic helper).

This cluster was also of interest to me because the family stayed near to where I am working, and is one of my favourite place to go to for my lunch break. And also the chance of that I had encountered case 29 (the father) before he  was admitted to hospital on 5 Feb, made me avoid my mother for almost 2 weeks.

As a parent there is nothing to fear in regards to bringing home the illness to your children. You biggest concern should be maintaining  your ability to take care of your family by ensuring you can weather any economic downturn and that you have a suitable situation should you and your wife/partner/girlfriend both get a moderate case of coronavirus. This is good advice in general. 

From a personal anecdote my wife and I both got the flu at same time along with our 2 year old daughter. Getting through that was pretty challenging. Because we were all sick it was also a problem to get help from our family because we didn’t want to get them sick. We were sick for about 9-10 days and wiped out with very little energy and tired all the time for an additional week. During all this our daughter bounced back in about 4-5 days so two sick adults were trying to manage 1 crabby 2 year old.

How did this article's author get to these numbers? In the article they say they looked at state health department sites and other articles but don't present the actual numbers they tabulated. In their own article they mention California can do more than 6000 tests per day and Washington can roughly do 1000 tests per day.

I'm gonna try and follow their methodology and calculate the numbers myself and present the sources."

Both were having flu like symptoms last weekend (a week ago) and went to ER at our tiny rural hospital. They were told they had no testing for COVID-19 available and to go home and self quarantine. They were never tested and so they will go uncounted IF they were indeed carriers. 

Knowing this information - two people in a rural town potentially carriers and NO WAY of testing of reporting to local health dept / CDC- makes me more than wonder how much more widespread this actually is.

Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face and eyes. Don’t share drinks / utensils. Stay home if you feel sick.

Standard flu symptoms, no difficulty breathing, we have no concerns about COVID-19. His cough was bad enough to keep him from lying down or sleeping, and he was miserable. He called Teledoc to try to get some prescription cough medicine so he could at least get some sleep. 

He had traveled to the UK in early January. Teledoc doctor  insisted that because he had traveled “overseas” in the last 2 months - not 14 days, like CDC guidelines - he wouldn’t do anything for him and he had to get tested for COVID-19.

Our local hospital system sent everyone messages this week telling us they aren’t  testing for COVID-19 and there were no plans to make test kits available to local practices. That only the CDC could say who gets tested.

His only other option would have been to go find someone more reasonable at urgent care, further exposing me (he was coughing bad enough to not be able to drive) and everyone in the vicinity (he was VERY symptomatic). 

He chose to tough it out. He hasn’t slept in 3 nights. All he wanted was some damn cough medicine with codeine, since the OTC stuff (and home remedies) weren’t helping enough. The misinformation, conflicting medical advice, and lack of a coherent response to this, compounded by an active flu season, is just mind-boggling."

Our first positive case was on Sunday, the second and third on Wednesday and at 2pm local time there were 11 positive cases. Those are also spread out over the country, so it's not a case of there being a local hotspot that can be focused on.

I’m a RN and our state lab (the only lab running covid-19 tests),Can run 160 tests per day max.  Per our governor, this is just enough capacity to offer testing to the known direct contacts of 2 positive cases in the state. 

An RN who cared for a positive patient made a statement that was aired on mainstream media yesterday describing how she was unable to get tested also...

It’s now public knowledge that the public is being lied to by the federal government.  healthcare workers, doctors, nurses are literally unable to do anything to change the situation until the corporate labs get set up to run tests, which we’re told will happen in a few weeks... this all needed to be done weeks ago and now we’re all paying the price.  It’s terrifying."

As well as a headache, extreme fatigue, dry cough, diarrhea, and extreme shortness of breath. Only thing that scared me was the shortness of breath, I'm 21 years old, healthy, and a non-smoker. I've never had shortness of breath before. My chest feels tight and it feels impossible to take a deep breath naturally. Occasionally I'll feel a sharp pain in my chest after breathing. 
No runny nose though. I don't really have much congestion tbh. I also don't really have flu like symptoms. I have an appetite, and my muscles don't ache (although my back hurts from laying in bed all day.)

On the 2nd day I seriously thought I was gonna die because I couldn't breathe. I went to the ER and after they did basic vital tests, said I was fine. They drew some blood and I got incredibly tired and honestly don't remember much of how I got home. 

My symptoms have since got worse, and now have a sore throat (probably from the coughing?) But I know the ER can't treat me so what's the point in going back. Im currently laying down struggling to breathe. I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm just supposed to head home for spring break and see my parents and family in a few days. Look, maybe what I haven't isn't coronavirus, hopefully it isn't, but I'd like to be tested so I know for sure that I can be around my family safely. 

If you have any other questions feel free to DM me.
Edit: if someone wants to tell me what this is besides Corona, lmk, I've had the flu a few times. Nothing like this. The flu was worse symptoms, except with the flu, I didn't ever get shortness of breath."

Deductibles through the roof and doctors don't trust patients any more. I pass kidney stones and I used to be trusted when I showed up at the ER begging for pain med while I passed a stone. Now I am treated as a potential drug seeker and forced to go through unnecessary and costly tests. Maybe because all the older boomer nurses have been replaced with non-empathetic personnel who treat you like garbage the moment you walk in.

Outbreak happens in China, they turn around all cargo ships that have sipplies/food/medicine leaving their country to bring it back. They force companies in the country to not ship materials out, and to keep them THERE because they need to use them. 

That means the supplies other countries started ordering / making got stopped and never made it to them. This is expected and should not be shocking to anyone.

On what base am I saying this?

In Italy we had what we call the patient #1, just him alone not knowing he had the virus started the epidemic outbreak in the north.

And he was infected by the patient #0, who guess what? He's German and didn't know he had the virus too.

But some of them saying it's like a flu-wave without a medicine.
And another reason is, universities, schools around me sending mails to students/families information about the virus telling wash your hands, stay away from crowded places.
Idk what other countries do, but in my city the hospitals already started preparing for this flu weeks ago. Telling people to not go outside if they feel sick. They should call the doctor/hospital or health office instead of going there.
Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds atleast. Try not shaking hands and dont cough in your hands.
So even if our politicians dont talk a lot about this topic, we got a lot of policies and breathings.
I can remember when the swine flu/bird flu was an recent-topic teachers gave us a handout with policies and information.

EDIT:
Guys, please remember: Always wash your hands.

*The patient had been given immunosuppressive drugs because of an upcoming organ transplantation. These drugs are supposed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs by the body.

Only reading news from few selected newspapers. And the moment I heard about the coronavirus I instantly deleted my facebook account.

So, the only thing I hear and read is, it is dangerous but newspapers use this disease as a perfect moment to release one headline after another.

The reason why I mentioned I deleted my social network profiles are obvious. Just taking a big distance to a lot of panic making news, overreactions and propaganda of conspiracy theory.

Sometimes I'm asking myself what the german facebook group ""killuminati"" talks about the coronavirus.
Saw an instagram story were an old friend was in the supermarket and bulk buyed stuff --> instagram deactivated, too.
So reddit and some selected newspaper are my main information source.

I don't even know if we have FOX as a TV channel. And I don't want to blame people bulk buying food.

I assume most “recovered” being tracked are hospitalized cases that have been discharged due to recovery.  Or in the case of China, they really might be testing everyone before you’re allowed out of quarantine (or whatever their situation is).

That's all I was pointing out with it - the outbreak hasn't gone on long enough for many cases to have concluded one way or another.

There are probably lot less of the un-tracked mild cases than you think, once a case is confirmed their contacts are tracked down, even the ones that only have mild cases still get tracked. They might be confirmed later than severe cases, but in the end they still get confirmed. That process catches a significant part of all the infected in a country, in some instances like Singapore and Hong-Kong enough to basically halt the outbreak locally, which means they must be finding most of them and early enough before they can infect anyone.

The video name says, a caregiver(23 yo) is infected Corona-Panic in the Clemens-August elementary school in Bonn
In the video they just say he had symptoms of an slight cold. They tested him between friday and saturday, but never say if the test is positive or negative.

So if you are paranoid you just accept that the test is positive but they hide information to just give a headline, have some clicks on youtube and make people panic. To be honest, I never heard something new about this case about the caregiver. 

Living for the weekend, it sounds so sad. But still a funny phrase :D"

I fear we are losing sight of the fact that there is a difference between:

(1) **Actual current cases** (unknown).

(2) Actual **current confirmed cases**, which is a known figure but never reported.

(3) **Total confirmed** **cases**, which is the number everyone is quoting but which is pretty useless in the grand scheme of things.

Now that the majority of confirmed cases in China have been declared cured, I think we should move away from reporting **total confirmed cases** and report on **current confirmed cases** instead. Of course, neither figure is likely to represent the true position, but every day that passes, the **total confirmed cases** figure becomes more and more meaningless.

To illustrate this, the John Hopkins [dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) as of now reports:

100,330 total confirmed cases,

55,694 total recoveries, and

3,408 total deaths.

This means reporting the 100,000 figure in the media gives the wrong impression that there are currently 100,000 people ""out there"" who are infected, when the reality is that the number of **current confirmed cases** is closer to 40,000 or 50,000 (assuming there is no doubling up with re-infections and the like).

I hope they stop using the total and start using a better metric to estimate the current status of the outbreak. If someone tells me that Ebola has infected more than 1,000,000 people (random figure), it doesn't give me any information as to how many are infected **now**."

If there were no quarantines, you would see a crazy high number here (my opinion).  So the rate was definitely slowed, and it more likely that we could see this fade away over time.  How much time would be undetermined.

I do however think that the reaction time was the learning here.  With a virus that spreads so quickly, but takes so long to show symptoms, the best way (again, my opinion) would have been to err on the side of caution and institute quarantines much quicker.  The issue here is that when arm-chair politicians / economists / doctors / whatever we are (I'm speaking about people like myself) take a look at what we should have done here; we do it from a selfish perspective of ""This is what I would do if the only thing I was worried about was containing the virus"".

We forget about the mass hysteria we could create (which could lead to more health issues), we forget about what happens if we REALLY tank the global economy (which we're seeing some effects of now), we forget about all the variables that would be implented around the world in all the different business areas, technology, social impacts, etc, etc."

It's also still around today as one of the yearly flus and it was likely the cause of the 1918 pandemic. Flu spreads easy and has a long infection time.

Dont you understand that if this media attention keeps up and less educated people begin to panic, chaos will erupt? 

People are already selling supermarkets across the nation out of certain supplies, and that will just be the start, it will progress to food (which it already has - to a minor extent) and could lead to increases in theft, crime rate, riots etc as people attempt to fend for themselves. 

Like I have stated in previous posts; This virus is for the most part, lethal to the elderly with pre-existing conditions. There are reports of 100+ year old people in 3rd world countries making full recoveries, yet people are locking themselves inside like its the black plague. 
We have survived many pandemics in the past, and have the necessary resources to prepare and protect for those forthcoming. 
If you choose to not accept my viewpoint, that is your opinion, but I truly believe that like all other strains of colds and flus have come in the past, this will be nothing more but a drop of water in the ocean"

This article deals with the status and efforts regarding the 2009 flu pandemic by country and continent/region.



As the pandemic progressed, laboratory testing and confirmation decreased. Confirmed figures for the United Kingdom, in particular, are only meaningful up to 2 July, when routine testing stopped and presumed cases were treated without laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries stopped issuing estimates of the infected population, making this list inaccurate.

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so.

During the Cold War, the term Third World referred to the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the nations not aligned with either the First World or the Second World.The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Eastern Bloc (or Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, ""Third World"" was a political, rather than an economic, grouping. In the decade following the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the term ""Third World"" was used interchangeably with ""developing countries"", but the concept has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world.

Spread is slow and checked and gradual. 

There is hard evidence saying warm weather helps. Only fly in the ointment is lack of testing. But then Iran didn’t test as well and at some point it got out of control. US is headed the same direction. Same is not true wrt Vietnam, Philippine or Malaysia and India, even Africa. Yes there are cases but it would have been bad by now, two months? into this already?

Think about it from the standpoint of the R0, though. Normal flu has an R0 of around 1.2 which means it only just spreads to more than 1 person on average, but in the summer it drops below 1 so flus peter out. Because nCoV is like R0 3.5ish, it could drop down to 1.5 in the summer *and still spread faster than the flu*. Of course, if everyone is taking preventative care it could drop the R0 below 1, but it is no certainty that the whole thing will blow over with warm weather, especially if it has achieved significant spread by then."

Some of my theories on why viruses work better in the cold:

1.) Not as much rain to wash away viruses and dirt containing the viruses from sidewalks. People's shoes are also not as likely to come into contact with flowing/fresh rain water, which naturally helps to clean off shoes (a lot of germs enter your home through your shoes, so take them off!)

2.) People stay inside more often, which means more people are more likely to breath the same air and touch the same objects.

3.) Immune systems may be comprimised in winter due to less sunlight, change in diet, and less physical activity.

4 ) Lower temperatures help viruses to live longer outside of a host (your body)

I could be totally wrong about all this, but thats my anedotal opinion."

People will say this doesn't translate to climates just because hottest temperatures only get to around 110 Fahrenheit outdoors in some places during summer. But that is not the only factor. You have to consider things like humitdity.

The key is the weather slowing down the spread where droplets are not as effectivly spread. Also small things like the UV and sun radiating on objects outside, those temperatures of objects are higher (you ever get burned by a seat belt, touch a hot car, burn your feet on sand, asphalt) and the virus won't last as long.

Still highly depends on hygiene and cooperation of everyone.

Seriously though, that gives a 100% US infection in two months, even as a dedicated doomer, I think that's wildly exaggerated.

1. It'll never get to 100% - 50% would be unprecedented
2. I don't think it's going to double every 3 days, we are in the early discovery phase of new testing where preexisting victims are found, this increases the apparent rate. Doubling every 7 days maybe for first few weeks.
3. That rate of doubling will decrease as easy targets diminish and a more informed and isolated population remains, See China for a exaggerated version of this effect.

So I reckon, if things go badly, we may see 50% spread in the US by next year some time, right about when a usable vaccine becomes available. This is still gonna mean a lot of dead people and overloaded hospitals."

This sub could easily become overwhelmed with political discussion; we therefore wish to limit it. The line is inevitably blurred, but we use a distinction between policy and politics. Policy is fine, politics is better posted elsewhere. News articles that mention or quote elected officials will be given extra scrutiny and if their content is primarily political rather than about policy, they will be removed. Likewise, editorialized headlines, whether by the submitter or the news article itself will likely be removed. Comment sections of political submissions will be locked early and often. Virtually the entire internet is set up to allow you to argue with others about your political opinions if you find that you must do so. People who cannot make the politics vs policy distinction may be banned."
